when the train stopped at the station, I opened my eyes and
looked out of the window. I saw a woman on the platform. She
was tall and bland with blue eyes. The train moved and I closed
my eyes. it was 4:00 p.m. and the train was full.

“Excuse me. Can i sit here?" I opened my eyes again. It was the
tall, llzlond woman.

“Sure." I answered. She sat down next to me. There was a nice
smell. Chanel No. 5. I started to listen to music on my phone.

“I love Chopin."

“Sorry?" I said.

"You're listening to Chopin. I love classical music." She smiled.
Her eyes were very blue.

We talked about music until the train arrived at Paddington

I looked at my watch. ‘‘OK,'' I said. "I have time."

A Uni ue Culture

l studied for three months at Al—Ah|iyya Amman University.
in Amman, the capital of Jordan. It was a life-changing
experience. Every day was a new adventure — very different
from my life in the US. While i was there. I studied US
politics in the Middle East, the history of the Arab world.
and Arabic language.

 

People often ask me what my favorite memory is, but it's
difﬁcult to answer because there are so many! I loved
riding a camel in the Wadi Rum desert and I went on an
amazing excursion to Petra. The countryside was beautiful
and completely different from where I live in the US. I also
enjoyed the unique culture of Jordan. Of course. there were
things that I sometimes found difﬁcult, but everybody from
Jordan was very understanding and friendly.

My recommendation
for people who want

to study abroad is to

go to a country that is
completely different
from where you live and
to stay as long as you can.
I loved learning about
another culture and I
think studying abroad is
a great experience.

Interviewer Hi, Neah. Tell us a little about
your experience. Where are you working?

Neah I'm working in a clothes store called
Rue2‘|.

Interviewer What kind of clothes does
Rue21 have?

Neah Uh, well, clothes for men and women,
casual clothes, pants, T-shirts, sweaters,
things like that.

Interviewer What do you do every day?

Neah Well, uh, I help the customers find
the clothes that they're looking for. It's a
big store and it has a lot of things. People
sometimes can't see the things that they
want.

Interviewer Do you like working there?

Neah Yes, I love it. The people are really
nice to me. I'm making a lot of new
friends.

Interviewer Is there anything you don't
like?

Neah Well, we can't sit down. We're
standing up all the time. So that's really
hard.

Interviewer But, in general, you're happy?
Neah Oh, yes. And when my internship
ends, they say I can work here in the
summer. That's great for me. I really like
working in a clothes store.
Interviewer What do you wear at work?
Neah We wear clothes from the store.
Interviewer Are the clothes that you're
wearing today from Rue21?
Neah Yes, they are!

Q 1 2 3

Miriam really liked herjob — it was very
interesting. I worked from home, so I

was with the children a lot and I loved it.

In general, life was good. It was cheap —
cheaper than in the UK. We joined a sports
club, where the children learned to swim,
and I played a lot of tennis, one of my
favorite sports.

The people in Durham were very friendly.
They often invited us to their homes. it was
easy to meet people at the sports club, or
at the university where Miriam worked. And
there were so many new places to see! On
weekends, we visited some of the beautiful
national parks. They were very different
from English parks! In one park there was

a sign saying "don't disturb the snakes" —
Sacha loved it!

i also remember a trip to a country music
festival at a blueberry farm. It was fantastic.
First we listened to the music, and then we
picked a lot of blueberries — they're Elena's
favorite fruit. But after that trip she didn't
want to eat a blueberry for at least two
weeks!

We stayed in Durham for a year. After that
we returned to England because my wife's
job finished. But we loved our life in the US,
and we're thinking of going back there in
maybe two or three years.

Jenny Ah yes, I have it now.

Rob Turn left when you leave the station.
Then go straight on for a bit and turn right
