Marjan Jahangiri, originally from Iran, is one of the only women
professors of cardiac surgery in Europe. She does more than 300
operations a year. She lives in London with her husband and their
17~year—oId son, Darius.

Can you describe your daily routine?

I get up between 6:00 and 6:30
a.m., I get to work at 7:00, and
my meetings usually start at
7:30. After that, I don't have a
break. I have lunch at my desk. I
often do two operations a clay,
and I also have lectures and
more meetings. At home, I have
dinner with my son. Between
9:30 and 11:30 p.m., I do research and I watch the news on TV. One

or two nights a week I'm on call, sol probably need to do operations
during the night. I often work on weekends, too. But that's OK — I think
I have a great life because I love my work.

 

How do you balance work with your family life?

I spend a lot of trrne with my son. I want him to team about hard work
and good values, and I want to be an example for him. My husband is
away a lot, but we talk on the phone every day. I think one reason why
I am successful In my professional iife is because he isn't at home all
the time!

what do you do to relax?
I play the piano for an hour every day, Iate at night. I think it heips me
with my operations — it's technical in the same way. I also go to the
hair stylist twice a week. I do a lot of my research there! They turn
the music off for me, and I
use the time to read all my
' academic papers.

A North African story

PART I
Hassan and ‘Nalid are brothers. They live in a small house in
the desert, near the mountains, a long way from a town or
village. They’re very poor. They have no money and they
have no animals. Their house only has two rooms. Every day
is the same. They get up, and they have sweet black coffee for
breakfast. Then Hassan works in the ﬁelds - but Walid just sits
and looks at the hot, empty desert and the hot, empty sky.
They live with their mother. She takes care of them, but she’s
old and tired.

One day she says, “We're poor and hungry. Why don’t you
leave here and ﬁnd work? We need money for food and clothes.”

“If you want some money, you have your silver ring — you can
sell that,” answers ‘Walid.

“I can’t sell it,” she says. “It’s your fathers Every night I look
at it and remember him.”

Hassan wants to help his mother, and he decides to leave
home. His mother gives him bread, and water in a glass bottle.
He kisses her, and he walks towards the mountains.

PART 2

Hassan walks for five days through the mountains. The
sun shines. At night, it's very cold. Then one evening, he
arrives at a rich and beautiful palace. The prince in the
palace welcomes ‘him. He gives him food and drink, and
Hassan sleeps in a comfortable bed. There is one strange
thing H the windows have no glass.

The next day, Hassan says goodbye. “He wants to
thank the prince and give him something, but he

only has 3his empty water bottle. He gives ‘it V I b

to 5him. The prince is very surprised. A .3 ‘=’ i .
“What’s this?” he says. “I can see through i

it! It’s beautiful! It's wonderful!” 6

(‘He is very happy, and in return, he
gives Hassan a box.

“Don’t open 7it until you get home,” he
says. “And be careful with it. It’s very valuable.”

Hassan walks through the mountains again, and
after ﬁve days, he arrives home. Walid and 9 their
mother watch 9him open the box. He ﬁnds
100 gold coins inside. His mother is very
happy! “Hassan, you clever boy!” she. says.
“Now ‘Owe can buy food and clothesl”

The next night, Walid makes a plan.

“100 gold coins in return for a glass
bottle,” “ he thinks. “If I give the prince my
rnother’s silver ring, perhaps I can get 1,000
gold coins!”

So Walid gets up, goes very quietly into
his mother’s room, and takes “her ring
from a box under her bed. The next morning, he asks his
brother where the palace is, and he leaves.

Good times, bad times

Psychologist Dr. Cliff Arnall says the happiest day of the year is the
second Friday in July. It's easy to see why — its summer, it’s warm
outside, the evenings are light, and its the day before a weekend!
And the third Monday in January is the most depressing clay of the
year. Why? Because it's winter, the weather is usually gray and cold,
the days are dark, and Monday is the first day of the working week.
People are also often short of money after Christmas, and some people
feel bad after breaking their New Year’s resolutions.

THE MOMENT I WAKE UP...

Getting up in the morning is hard. but for many people.
music seems to help them start the day. There is
actually a list of perfect “wake—up songs” compiled by
a psychologist. David M. Greenberg, using data from
the music download website, Spotify.

When choosing the perfect “wake—up songs,"

Greenberg considered things like how the music

builds up. positive lyrics, and strong rhythm. He _<_=L*‘
says that the music needs to start gently. and ‘\
then slowly build up to help people to wake up.

It must have positive lyrics to
change people's mood from
bad to good. The rhythm also
needs to be strong, with a lot
of bass and drums.

  
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
   
  
 
 
 
   
 
  
 

Greenbergs top choice of song is
Viva La Vida, by Coldplay. which has all
the three necessary elements. “Science
shows that music affects us in all kinds of
ways. including emotionally, physiologically.
and in the brain,‘ he says. “The right music
— like Viva La Vida, with its positive
energy and strong momentum
— can help you wake up and
feel energetic for the rest of
your day."

What's your favorite
“wake-up song"? Leave
your comments below.

. NEW YEAR’S EVE -

ONE TO REMEMBER OR ONE TO FORGET?

This was last year. and I went
to a hotel with some friends. it had a
restaurant on the top floor. and that's
where the party was. We got there at

as about 11:00. About half an hour before

midnight I realized I didn't have my
phone — it was in my car. So I took the
elevator down to the parking lot. I found
my phone, and then I got back into the

no elevator — I was the only person in it. But

then, between the third and fourth floors.
the elevator stopped completely and I
couldn't get out. I pressed the button
and asked for help, but a guy said there

IS was an electrical problem and I needed

to wait. Then a few minutes later. I could
hear people outside celebrating. It was
awful — I didn’t get out until almost 1:00
in the morning. And on top of it all, my

20 friends didn't realize that I wasn't there!

I had a fantastic New Year's Eve in Iceland in 2013. First, we
went to a really expensive restaurant for dinner. It was early, about 6:00,
because that's when people have dinner in Iceland. I wore a fantastic dress,
but after dinner we got a taxi back to the hotel and I put on boots and a warm
jacket. Then we went out and watched the amazing fireworks. Suddenly. at
about 10:00, everyone went home to watch TV — there's this famous TV show
they always watch on New Year's Eve! It was really strange — the streets were
empty for a little bit. But then just before midnight, people came out again
and danced and sang till about 5:00 in the morning. It was incredible.

In 1916, in her book The El/fysterioztr Aﬁair at Styles, Agatha
Christie introduced a new type of detective novel, and
a new detective, Hercule Poirot. This book was a little
bit different because the plot was more important than
the characters and the writer asked readers to guess
the name of the murderer. Later, in the 1930s and
405, Dorothy Sayers wrote detective novels where the
relationships between the characters were sometimes
more interesting than the plot.

 
 
  
 

Reading can give us a fascinating view of the past, and
when we read these detective stories and novels, we
can also learn something about how people lived and
thought in the 19th and 20th centuries. These authors
are still very popular. They inﬂuence present-day
authors, such as].K. Rowling, and they are probably
going to inspire crime fiction for decades to come. _ »—r——

green vegetables

 

The good thing about this plan for me is that I spend less
time and money buying food, and I also never need to worry
if my diet is healthy or not (because I know it is). Now,
you’re probably thinking, “he's sure to get tired of eating the
same food every day.” Well, after about a year, I can promise
you that I’m not. I change my meals a bit by having different
kinds of cheese and using different herbs and spices. I also
change the vegetables that I have for dinner.

ABOUT ME

About me

Hi! l’m Stef, a traveler from Germany with
a passion for travel, food, and photography.

During my studies, I worked in the Canary Islands and in Argentina and
istudied for two semesters in the UK. After I ﬁnished, I decided that I didn't
want to work for the rest of my life. I was 21 and couldn't imagine sitting in
an office for the next 40 years or more. So, I decided to go to Australia on

05 a working vacation visa. First, I worked for six months in Germany because
I needed to save some money. I went to Sydney at the end of 20li. I spent
Christmas on St. Kilda Beach in Melbourne, I worked in a restaurant, and then I

traveled all over Australia and New Zealand.

After coming back, I got a job as a project assistant in an IT

no company — an ofﬁcejob. I was happy to have a routine again,
but i spent all my vacations traveling — to Thailand, Istanbul,
Portugal, Indonesia, Chile, Belize, and Morocco.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Some months passed, but ﬁnally I realized what I wanted
to do with my life, at least for now. Having experiences is
15 very important to me — more important than working in
an office all week to pay for an apartment that I
hardly ever spend time in, and to buy things I
don't really need. Three months ago, I left
myjob. I decided to work in different
20 jobs, sometimes here, sometimes
abroad, sometimes as a volunteer,
sometimes for money. I have a lot of
dreams and I want to make them come true.

on vacation

a horse

a language

What do you think of Stef’s lifestyle? Do you agree
that experiences are more important than things?

Life before
the internet

This morning in the office somebody mentioned

 

“carbon paper.” “What’s that?” our intern Francesca

asked. She genuinely had no idea. For all of you who
are too young to remember, we used carbon paper
to make one or two copies of a document as it was
typed. That's where the term “cc” or “carbon copy"
came from. After that conversation, we started

to remember life before the internet. Can you
remember any of these?

 

   

FAX .\lA(3l ll T‘-‘F.-‘>' Sending an email is so easy these days,
but some years ago. when you needed to send something to
somebody urgently and the mail was too slow, you sent a fax.
When they were introduced in the 19705. people thought they
were a technological miracle. "You can print something and
send it over the phone in seconds! Magic!”

   

TH E Y[Cl.L( }\\" PAC P15 If you needed to
make an appointment with your hair stylist or
call for Chinese take-out, what did you do? You
looked up the phone number or address in a big

it still exists online.

l'IT\'C‘a'(3l.¢ WP? Ill :15 When you needed information for
your homework, or to win an argument, you looked it up in
an enormous encyclopedia — sometimes ten or twelve books

W.-1 l-l~;M.-\ NS This is how we listened to

music. A Walkman was a lot heavier than
an MP3 player! And if you didn’t have

the cassette or CD of a song, you couldn’t
listen to it.

Ikaria, Greece

Ikaria is a small Greek island near the coast of Turkey. How

do the people there live? They eat a lot of beans, potatoes, and
green vegetables, and they sometimes eat fish, but they hardly
ever eat red meat or sugar. They drink a lot of herbal tea. They
do a lot of exercise, but they never go to a gym. They work in
their gardens, and they walk everywhere - not many people in
Ikaria have a car. They also take a siesta every afternoon.

Ikaria is a very safe place. In the village of Raches, the police
station is closed. The people say they don’t need police. People
also have a very good social life. The island is famous for its
tradition of panagiria, or festivals.
Between May and October, the
island has between two and four
festivals every week, where people
eat, drink, and dance all night.
They call Ikaria “the island where
people forget to die.”

Nicoya, Costa Rica

Nicoya is in northwest Costa Rica, near the border with Nicaragua.

Most of the people who live there are farmers. In Nicoya people eat small meals.
They usually have beans, rice, sweet potatoes, and sometimes a little meat,
an egg, or some cheese. They also have some unusual fruits, for example, the
mciraﬁdn, a fruit similar to an orange, with a lot of vitamin C. They drink a lot
of water - the local water is unusually rich in calcium and magnesium.

They are very active during the day — they work outside, and theywalk
everywhere, or ride horses. They don't watch television and they don’t use the
internet, so they go to bed when its dark and get up when its light. They sleep
well, usually eight hours a night.

All people in Nicoya have something called a plan de vida. It
means “a reason to get up every morning.” This may be work or
family, and ir’s what makes even people who are over 100 still
feel necessary.

My favorite day

G Match 2-! IIIavoritalwaekandiiamrlyllood

My favorite day of the week is Saturday
because it's the ﬁrst day of the weekend!

I get up very early during the week, so on Saturday
it’s nice to get up late, and I always stay in bed
until about 10:30. Then I usually go shopping with
a friend. In Mexico, stores are sometimes closed on
Sundays, so Saturday is the only day for shopping.
We don't always buy something, but we have fun
just looking.

I often have lunch with my mother and my brother.
It’s great because my mom is a really good cook — she
always makes things we like, and my brother and I
have time to talk about our week. After lunch,

I sometimes study from about 4:00 to 6:00,
especially if I have exams.

In the evening, I usually go out with my friends.
We often go to the movies. and after that, we have
a pizza or tacos. I never go to bed before 1:00, or
sometimes later.

Q) =_\_1='4

The best for worst) thing about the weather in
Chicago is that it's always changing. it can be
very hot or very cold. In the summer, it's mostly
sunny and sometimes cloudy, with temperatures
of about 84 degrees. And of course, sometimes
it rains.

in the winter, the temperature is usually between
29 and ‘I4 degrees. It can be below freezing (32
degrees) for weeks at a time. Brrr! it snows about
38 inches a year.

In the spring and the fall, the weather is very
changeable. You can have all four seasons in one
week. It can be cold and snowing on Monday,
cool and foggy on Tuesday, and warm and sunny
on Wednesday. I always tell tourists to bring a
winter coat, gloves, sunglasses, sandals, and an
umbrella when they visit Chicago in the spring
and the fall—that way they are prepared for any
kind of weather!

But one thing that isn't always true about
Chicago is the wind. Even though Chicago's
nickname is "The Windy City," it's not always
windy there. In fact, Boston has more windy

days a year than Chicago. Some people think
Chicago's nickname is from politicians who talk
too much!

The prince welcomes him and gives him food

coins.

The next morning, he says to the prince, "I want

ring. it's my mother's."

The prince is very ha py. "This is a beautiful
ring," he says. "Than you. Let me give you
something in return."

He gives Walid a box. "Don't open this until you
get home," he says. "Be careful with it. It's very,
very valuable."

Walid runs through the mountains, and after
three days, he arrives home.

"Where's my silver ring?" shouts his mother.
"Don't worry about your ring!" says Walid.
"Look at thisl"

This painting is a seIf—portrait by the Dutch
painterVincent van Gogh.

Van Gogh was born in the Netherlands on
March 30th, 1853. His parents weren't poor — his
father was a church minister, and his mother
was an artist. Van Gogh's first job was in his
uncle's company, selling paintings, but later

he was a teacher, and finally a painter. We only
really know what he looked like because of his
many self-portraits. Only three photographs

of him exist, and they are all from when he was
young. This ortrait is from his time in Aries in
the South o France, in 1888, when he was 35.
He was very poor, but he was happy because of
the beautiful light and colors there. This portrait
was a present for his friend, the ainter Paul
Gauguin. Gauguin and van Gog were together
in Aries for a month. Van Gogh was not strong
mentally, and the relationship between them
was difficult. After a big fight, van Gogh cutoff
his ear, and was in a mental hospital for some
time. He died on July 29th, 1890. He was only
37 years old. His paintings weren't popular
during his lifetime, and he was never rich or
famous. But today, people think that Vincent
van Gogh is one of the greatest painters in the
world, and his aintings, like Sunflowers and
The Starry Nig t, sell for millions of dollars.

Edward Gamson lives in Washington, DC. Afew
years ago, he and his friend Lowell decided to go
on vacation to Granada in Spain. Edward wanted
to visit the Alhambra, a famous palace. They
researched flights online and booked tickets for
the two of them. Their tickets were expensive,
but Edward decided to s end extra money on
first-class seats. On the cgy of their flight, they
arrived at Dulles Airport and parked their car in
the long-term parking lot. Edward and Lowell

checked in for the first part of their trip. They
traveled safely to London, changed planes at
Heathrow Airport, and settled into their second
flight. Twenty minutes into the flight, Lowell
looked at Edward with surprise.

»

Lowell Edward, I think we're going west and
not south to Granada.

Edward Hmm. Let's ask the flight attendant.
Excuse me, why aren't we going south to
Spain?

Flight Attendant Spain? We're not going to
Spain. We're going to Grenada, the island in
the Caribbean.

Edward The Caribbean? But I booked tickets to
to Granada. Spain.

Flight Attendant Let me check your ticket. Oh,
I see. I'm really sorry, but your ticket isn't for
Granada, Spain. it's for Grenada, in the West
Indies.

Edward No, it can't be.

Flight Attendant i’m very sorry, but it is. Look,
it clearly says Grenada — it's spelled correctly.

Lowell I don't believe it. Edward, did you check
the airport when you booked?

Edward Well, no, I didn't. I was in vacation
mode and I didn't think about it.

Lowell Ugh! What are we going to do?

Flight Attendant When we land, you need to
book new tickets to fly from Grenada in the
Caribbean to Granada in Spain.

Friend What was your best ever New Year's
Eve? One you always remember?

Denisa Oh, definitely 2014, when i was in Rio.

Friend Who were you with?

Denisa I was with my boyfriend Marcelo, who's
Brazilian.

Friend Why was it so special?

Denisa Well, Brazil has special traditions for
New Year's Eve, and they were all new for
me. For example, it's a Brazilian tradition
to wear white clothes for New Year's Eve
because white is a symbol of peace, so I wore
a beautiful white dress that Ma rcelo's mother
bought me. i have a photo somewhere on my
phone. Yes, here, look!

Friend How pretty. So what did you do?

Denisa Uh, let me think. Well, first we had a
typicai New Year's Eve dinner with Marcelo’s
family. And then, I guess it was about ten, we
got a bus to Copacabana.

Friend What was the atmosphere like there?

Denisa Oh, it was amazing! The streets were
already full of people. We went to a show at
a place near the beach. It was great, and we
danced the samba.

Friend Wow. Were you there at midnight?

Denise No, no. When we saw it was almost
midnight, we went to the beach, and the
typical countdown started, you know — ten,
nine, eight...Happy New Year! Everywhere we
heard the sound of people celebrating, and
we watched the wonderful fireworks.

Friend it sounds great. What did people do
when the fireworks finished?

Denisa Most people went to other parties, or
they went home.

Friend And what about you?

Denisa We decided to go to a different beach,
a beach called Praia do Arpoador, and we
took our first swim of the new year. It was
magical.

Barbara Let's go upstairs. Follow me...Be
careful. The ceiling is very low here.

Leo It's a very old house.

Barbara Yes, the house is 300 years old. My
family lived here for nearly 80 years. There are
six bedrooms. This was my father's bedroom.

Kim Is there heat in the house?‘

Barbara Yes, there is. Why do you ask? Are you
cold?

Kim Yes, it's very cold in here.

Leo That's because we're from California.

Barbara Let's go and see the other bedrooms.

Leo Yes, of course.

Leo Well, what do you think, Kim? I love it! Don't
you?

Kim I'm not sure. There's something about the
house I don't like.

Leo Kim, it's perfect for the kids. Think of the
yard. And it's a real, authentic country house.
What do you say?

Kim I guess so. If you're sure.

Leo I am sure! Miss...uh, Barbara. We want it.
We want to rent the house.

coffee, thanks.

Waiter Here you are!

Leo Well, here's to our new house!

Kim Yes!

Waiter You're new around here, aren't you?

Leo Yes, that's right.

Kim We just rented the big house on Darwin

Waiter Which house? The Travers family house?

Leo Yes.

Waiter Oh.

Leo ls something wrong?

Waiter Who showed you the house?

Kim Barbara. The old lady who lived there
before.

Waiter Ah, Barbara. Old Mr. Travers's daughter.
Some people thought that she was the one
who did it.

Kim The one who did what? What happened?

Waiter Didn't she tell you?

Kim Tell us what?

Waiter About the murder.

Leo 8: Kim Murder?

Waiter Yes, Mr. Travers was murdered in that
house in 1%5...in his bed.

Kim Oh, how horrible!

Waiter The man who killed Mr. Travers was
Barbara's lover. The family never lived there
again. They tried to sell the house, but nobody
wanted to buy it. Not after a murder. That's
why that house is always rented. Barbara never
married, of course.

Leo Kim?

Kim Yes?

Leo Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Kim Yes — I don't want to live in a house where
somebody was murdered. Come on. Let's go.

Waiter Hey, hey, your coffee! You didn't drink
your coffee...Ah, well.

1 We stayed at The Roosevelt Hollywood for two
nights. It's a really nice place — a very elegant,
very LA hotel. The service, atmosphere,
and room were excellent, and we really
enjoyed our stay. But we had a really strange
experience. On the first night, we woke up at

' 0 Go online to listen to the audio and see all the Listening scripts  E

3:30 in the morning. There was a strange noise
outside our door, like someone softly playing a
trumpet. To tell you the truth, we were a littie
bit frightened. Why would someone play the
trumpet in the middle of the night? Then we
thought that it was probably another guest

in the hall, and maybe they were listening to
music on their cell phone or something, and we
went back to sleep. But on the second night,
the same exact thing happened. So wejust
thought, strange, maybe it's because it's an old
hotel and the walls are thin. But when we got
home, we told the story to a friend, and he told
us that The Roosevelt Hollywood is haunted.
We looked on the Internet, and we read that
people say that room 924 has a ghost! And

our room was 922, the next room! We sent an
email to The Roosevelt Hollywood and told
them about it, and they sent us some really
interesting information about the ghost stories.
We'd really like to stay in this fantastic hotel
again, but maybe not in room 9243.

2 I stayed at The Roosevelt Hollywood in May of
last year with my husband. It's a beautiful hotel,
with a great location. It's right on Hollywood
Boulevard. We were in a room on the eighth
floor. We knew that people said there were
ghosts, and we knew about room 924, but we
weren't worried at all. We had a nice meal at
a nearby restaurant and then we went to bed.
But in the middle of the night — about 3:00 in
the morning — we suddenly woke up and we
could hear loud noises from the room above
us. They were really loud noises — like people
were dropping their heavy suitcases on the
floor. Anyway, after two or three minutes, the
noises stopped and we went back to sleep.
There weren't any more strange noises, and
we slept for the rest of the night. The next
morning, we went to reception and said, "We
slept very poorly last night — the people in
the room above us made so much noise." The
man at reception asked for our room number
and said, "Let me check." He looked on the
computer and he said, ”The room above you is
empty." So I said, "Are you sure?" And he said,
"Yes. The room above yours is room 924. There
wasn't anybody in that room last night." We
checked out of the hotel the same morning.
Never again!

1 This is for my foodie friends. In case you
thought lettuce was only for salads, here
I'm cooking it in some butter with an onion.
Then I add some mushrooms, chicken, fresh
tomatoes, and some other things e not sure
yet. Lettuce is also great in soups, or you can
grill it and serve it with blue cheese.

2 We didn't feel like cooking last night, and
besides, we didn't have any food in the
house, so we decided to order some take-out
salads from our wonderful local pizzeria.
They were all very good, but my favorite
was a chicken salad with carrots, tomatoes,

3 Brunch Sunday afternoon at a restaurant in
the East Village, called Timna. We had lots of
different sharing plates. I loved everything,
especially this dish called shakshuka, which
is North African, and it's basically eggs in a
tomato sauce, but the mixture of herbs and
spices makes it taste great. And the bread we
had to dip in the sauce was wonderful, too.

Host Good evening. Welcome to Quiz
Night. Our first contestant is Eddie from
Washington, D.C. Hi, Eddie. Are you nervous?

Eddie No, not really. I think I'm, uh, ready.

Host Well, let's hope so. The rules are the
same as always. I'm going to read you some
sentences, and you have ten seconds to say
if the sentence is true or false. If you get the
first answer right, you win $100. Then for each
correct answer, you double your money, so
if you get the second answer right, you win
$200, and for the third correct answer, you
win $400. For eight correct answers, you win
$12,800. But if you get an answer wrong, you
lose all the money. Remember, you can also
call a friend, so if you're not sure about one of
the answers, you can call yourfriend to help
you. is that OK, Eddie?

Eddie Yeah, OK.

‘:1

Host OK, Eddie, first question for $100. A
whale can make a louder noise than a lion.
True or false?

Eddie Awhale can make a louder noise than a
lion. Uh, true.

Host Correct. Blue whales can make a sound
of up to 188 decibels whereas a lion's roar is
never more than 114 decibels. Ro—a—rrrr. Now,
for $200, World War I was shorter than World
War II. True or false?

Eddie Uh, I think it's true.

Host Correct. It's true. World Warl lasted four
years, from ‘I914 to 1918, but World War II
lasted six years, from 1939 to 1945. Next, for
$400, the American movie industry is bigger
than the Indian movie industry.

Eddie I think it's false. You know, Bollywood
and all that is huge. I think it's false.

Host Correct. The Indian movie industry is

much biggerthan the American one. It
produces about 1,000 movies every year,
which is double what Hollywood produces.
In fact, the US isn't even the second country
that makes the most movies, which is Nigeria.
Next, for $800, in July, Seattle is hotter than
Sydney. True or false?

Eddie In July, Seattle is hotter than Sydney.

Uh, true.

Host Correct. The average temperature in July
in Seattle is 75 degrees Farhenheit, and in
Sydney it's 62 degrees Fa rhenheit. Of course,
Australia's in the southern hemisphere, so it's
winter there. Next, for $1,600, silver is heavier
than gold. True or false?

Eddie Uh, true. No, uh, false.

Host Do you want to call a friend?

Eddie I think it's false. I rememberfrom science
class at school. Gold is heavier than silver.

Host Correct. Gold weighs about 10.16 ounces
per cubic inch and silver weighs only 5.53
ounces. That means that gold is almost
twice as heavy as silver. OK, for $3,200, the
mountain K2 is more difficult to climb than
Mount Everest.

Eddie Uh, true.

Host Correct. 30% of the people who try
to climb K2 die, usually on the way down,
whereas only 5% of the people who try to
climb Everest die. OK, Eddie, now for $6,400,
driving in Italy is more dangerous than driving
in the US. True or false?

Eddie Uh, I think that's a trick question. We
all think Italians drive really fast, but maybe
they're good drivers. I think it's false.

Host Good job, Eddie! It may be hard to
believe, but in fact, out of every 100,000

 

people, six people died because of car
accidents in Italy, corn ared to approximately
12 in the US. And final y, the last question.

Be very careful, Eddie. if you get it right, you
win $12,800, but if you get it wrong, you get
nothing. Are you ready?

Eddie Yes, ready.

Host OK, for $12,800, it's better to exercise in
the morning than in the afternoon.

Eddie Uh...uh...

Host Quickly, Eddie, your time is almost up.

Eddie I think it's false, but I'm not sure. I want
to call a friend.

Host OK, Eddie. So, who do you want to call?

Eddie Sandra.

Host Is she your girlfriend?

Eddie Yes, she is.

Host OK, then. Hello, is this Sandra?

Sandra Yes, itis.

Host I'm calling from Quiz Night. Eddie needs
some help. You have 30 seconds, Eddie. Here
she is.

Eddie Hi. Sandra?

Sandra Yes.

Eddie Listen. it's the last question, ”It's better
to exercise in the morning than in the
afternoon." True or false? I think it's false.

Sandra Uh, I think it's true. I always see people
running in the park in the morning...

Eddie Googie it. Quickly. On your phone.

Sandra What do I put in?

Eddie That sentence and see what comes up!
"lt's better to exercise in the morning than in

Interviewer Gunnar, can you give us a quick
update on your trip?

Gunnar OK, so we left istanbul 20 minutes late,
at 1:30 in the morning — not a good start.
But we arrived in Casablanca more or less on
time. We visited the mosque at 4:30 in the
morning. We couldn't go inside though — we
just saw it from the outside! Then we went
back to the airport and flew to Paris. When
we arrived, we rushed outside and took some
photos, and then went back in to a different
terminal. It was really stressful, the most
stressful part of the trip — but we got to the
gate just in time for our flight to Punta Cana.
When we got there, we went to a beach that
was about 12 miles from the airport, and
we relaxed there for a little bit, and then
went back to the airport and got our flight
to Caracas. And we arrived here at 10:00 at
night, and we officially entered the country
at 10:15. So — five continents in one day! We
did itl

.._,,_ .

if you're thinking of taking a vacation or

traveling somewhere nice, the lanning can be

complicated. The internet is fulljof reviews of
hotels, restaurants, and attractions. There are so
many different ways of traveling, and thousands
of laces to go. Where do you start? Why not
fol ow these three simple steps to find the right
vacation for you.

Step 1. Think about what you want to do on your

vacation. The first thing people usually try to

decide is where they want to go, but it's probably

better to start by thinking about what you want

to do. Do you want to relax? Then think about

how you relax. For example, do you like reading,
or doing yoga, or do you like doing something
more active? Do you want to go somewhere
completely different? Do you want to visit an
exciting new city, or see some scenery and
animals that are different from where you live?

Seeing something completely new is a great way

to forget about your normal life. Do you want to

go on an adventure? Perhaps you're dreaming
about climbing Everest or living with an African
tribe. You could use your vacation to make one
of those dreams come true. Do you want to learn
something new? Not everybody wants to sit in

a classroom learning Spanish or be In a kitchen

learning to cook when they're on vacation, but

some people love it. And nowadays, you can

take courses in many countries and experience a

different culture at the same time.

So now, Step 2. Think about the peo ie you're

going to go with. Are they family or riends? Do

they have children? What do they want to do?

People have different needs and interests, and if

you're all going to enjoy the vacation, you need

to make sure you all want the same things. But if
what you really want to do is to meet new people,
maybe it would be betterto travel alone.

And finally, Step 3. Think about good vacations

you had in the past. Why were they good?

Maybe it was the people you were with. Maybe it

was something you learned, or an experience you

had. What can you repeat from those vacations?

Of course, there are always other things you need

to consider, like how much money you can spend,

and how much time you can be away. But first,
follow these three steps, and then you're ready to
start thinking about where you want to go!

Part 2

Jane Well, I have a problem with my boyfriend.
We argue all the time. I'm not sure that he
loves me. I want to know if we're going to stay
together.

Jirn Please choose five cards, but don't look at
them...Ah, this is a good card. This means
you're going to be very lucky.

Jane But am I going to stay with my boyfriend?

Jim Maybe...We need to look at the other
cards first.

LT) .

Part 4

Jim Now I can see everything clearly. You're
going to leave your boyfriend and go away
with the other man, with Jim...to another
country. And very soon, you're going to get
married.

Jane Married? To Jim! But am I going to be
happy with him?

Jim You're going to be very happy together. I'm
sure of it.

Jane Oh no, look at the time. I'm going to be
late for work.

The first thing that I really noticed when I arrived
here was how incredibly friendly the people are.
The "ticos" — that's what they're called — are
much friendlier than people from my home
country. They always say buenos dies to you,
even if they don't know you. And If somethIng’s
good, like a beautiful day or a good meal, they
say pura vida, which I love. It literally means
"pure life," but I think it really means "things are
great," or something like that. One thing that
can be difficult though, their sense of time is
completely different from ours — they call it "tico
time." If they have an appointment at, let's say,
seven in the evening, they probably leave home

at seven o'clock, so they're always late. Luckily, my

school works on what they call "British time," so
classes start punctually!
Another thing that surprised me was the weather.
I thought Costa Rica was hot and sunny all the
time. That's true in the dry season, and the
temperature's about 77 degrees all year round,
but in the rainy season, especially In September
and October, it rains really heavily for maybe
two hours a day. Really amazing rain, nothing like
at home.
Everyone told me that the scenery was beautiful
in Costa Rica, but it was even more beautiful than
I expected. Incredible animals, birds, trees — and
volcanoes. Some of them are active and smoke

uietly, and then suddenly there's a big bang and
t ey start erupting. I was very frightened the first
time it happened.
What else? Uh, I thought that life here was
going to be very cheap, but In fact, food is very
expensive, especially Imported food. The only
thing that's cheap is fruit, vegetables, and coffee
— wonderful, wonderful coffee. And the fruit and
vegetables are very different from what we have
at home. One day, I went to a market and I didn't
recognize any of the fruit.
I like San Jose. I don't feel that it's dangerous, but
it probably is. A colleague ofmine was In a taxi
the other day, and the taxi driver robbed him of
his money! And the roads are terrible, especially
In the rain! But in general, I love it here.

A I What kind of phone do you have?

A I have an iPhone.

I How old is it?

A Uh, about two years old.

I How often do you change phones?

A Not very often, I would say. I like to, uh,

sometimes use?

Galaxy, I think.

transportation apps for buying train tickets or

sometimes use?

C I have a "night sky" app. If it's a starry night, I
sometimes use that. You point your phone at
the sky and it tells you the names of the stars
and planets and things.

(I: ' . 

A Yes, I have. I drive a lot for myiob, several hours
a day, and I like listening to books — it's much
better than listening to the radio. I probably
listen to a couple of books every week.

B Yes, I've seen Blade Runnerat least ten times.
It's a really great movie, I never get tired of it, I
always notice something new.

C No, never. I've definitely fallen asleep watching
TV, but never at the movies.

D Yes, I have. When I'm stressed, I sit on the couch
with my blanket, turn on Netflix, and spend the
evening watching my favorite TV show, Parks
and Recreation. I can easily watch four orfive
episodes one after the other.

E No, I haven't. It usually takes me along time to
finish a book, so I never read them again.

F Yes, I bought the soundtrack of Catching Fire,
you know, The Hunger Games, afterl saw the
movie. It has some amazing music: Coldplay,
Imagine Dragons, Christina Aguilera.
