.1 

“So, how was the date?’ ’

You probably think this is a parent asking the question to their child.
But many children are now helping their single parents ﬁnd love, too.

Clint Bouchez, a 52-year~old businessman was divorced ten years
ago. His daughter, 26-year-old Charlotte, doesn’t want her dad to

' end up alone — her mom remarried ﬁve years ago, and Charlotte

has a boyfriend.

Charlotte and Clint are very close. They often go out together in the
evening, they’re planning a trip to India for later in the year, and
they’re both Bruce Springsteen fans. But Charlotte thinks that Clint
needs a new partner, and he agrees.

“My dad is the perfect man,” she says. “He’s warm, he’s generous,
he knows how to look after a woman, how to treat a woman. He's a
gentleman. He's always the one who pays on dates. He's romantic
and he’s fun. I don't mind spending Friday and Saturday nights
with my dad and that says a lot — I’m only 26."

Dating in the 21st century is very different from when Clint was
young. Internet dating has changed everything. "It's difficult now
just to walk over to a Woman and ask her ‘Can I buy you a drink?”
he says. "Before, when you met people face to face, there was
sometimes a ‘spark,’ a feeling of romantic destiny — you don't get
that from someone’s proﬁle picture.”

Charlotte wrote C1int's dating proﬁle for an online dating
website. Clint would like to meet a woman who works, preferably
a businesswoman. Someone who’s independent, but funny and
smart. He has had several dates, but none of the women were right
for him. He and Charlotte are still looking. “I'm always hopeful,"

he says. "I really believe that sooner or later I’m going to find

‘the one.”

‘‘ Last year, I went on vacation. to the Andes in Peru
with a group of friends. One day, we climbed a
mountain - well, it wasn't really a climb, but it was a
long walk — and it took about two hours to get to the
top. When we got there, we had lunch. The view was
amazing — we could see the ocean in the distance. We
took photos andjust sat in the sun for a while.

Then we went down again, and when we got back to
the car, I wanted to take another photo, but I coulcln’t
find my phone — it wasn't in my bag. I thought, "Oh no!
it's probably at the top of the mountain, where we had
lunch." l decided the only thing to do was to go back
up the mountain to get it because I didn't want to leave
my phone up there. My friends said, ’’OK, but you cant
go on your own,” so in the end we all went up again,
which was another two hours.

When we got to the top we spent about half an
hour looking for the phone, but we couldn't ﬁnd it
anywhere. Then it started to get colder — it was now
late afternoon — so I took my jacket out of my bag,
and... my phone was in my jacket pocket!

I felt terrible, and really stupid! My friends were very 
nice about it, but they never let me forget it! -

The Guardian newspaper has a weekly feature called That‘: me
in the picture, where people describe famous photos they were
in. This photo was sent in by Jane Rangeley.

I was working for an advertising agency. That summer, I went on

a camping vacation with my parents in the south of France. One
night, I went to a nightclub on the beach and I met a young Frenchman,
and we fell in love. When I got home, I immediately started looking
for a job in Paris. He was at the university there - he was studying
medicine. In the end, Ifound a job as a secretary with UNESCO. and I
went to live there.

We lived together for six years. On Sundays, we often went for a
walk, and one of our favorite places was the botanical gardens. It had a
zoo, and I often put some bread in my pocket to give to the animals. We
were walking in the gardens one Sunday in the fall when we stopped
because a lot of noise was coming from one of the trees. There was
an owl there, maybe escaped from the zoo, and some little birds were
attacking it. I also noticed a man with a camera. When we started
walking again, I said, "Why was that man taking photographs of us?”

I now know that Cartier-Bresson often waited in parks in Paris
for the perfect photo opportunity. The following year, one of my
boyfriends friends saw the photo in a magazine. Before I returned
to London. I called the magazine and I got Cartier-Bresson's phone
number. I was very shy, but I called him. He was very friendly, and he
sent me a copy. Years later I met him and he signed the photo for me.

I love this picture. It was a happy time for me. And although my
French boyfriend and I broke up in the end, we're still in touch.

In 1972, Iwas living in London. I was in my early twenties. and

C3 How to take better vacation photos

Vacation time is the one time we all take photos. We're
in a strange new place, the sun is shining, and we want
to record our surroundings and happy memories. So how
do we take the perfect vacation photos? Here are three
useful tips...

.1,

I took this photo in Bruges in

Belgium. 1 got up and, when my

friends were having breakfast, 1

went for a walk with my camera.

This gave me three advantages:

— The sun was low in the sky and
the light was beautiful and
warm.

- There were no people around.
— My friends didn't need to wait patiently when I was taking
photos.

The light in the evening is also good, but there are a lot
more people around. There are times, in the local market,
for example, when having lots of people in the photo can be
a good thing, but most of the time I prefer my photos to be
less crowded.

 

I took these two photos of the Forbidden City in Beijing,
and I think the picture on the right is much better. Try not to
take exactly the same picture as millions of other people -
iook for little details that other photographers haven't seen.

Although I am a very enthusiastic photographer, I often buy
a nice postcard of the places l visit — much better than going
home with pictures that arerrt very good.

These are the gardens outside
the Louvre in Paris. We spent
all day looking at the paintings, "
and we were walking back

to the hotel when we saw
someone feeding the birds. I
only had my little camera with
me, but it was all I needed. I
quickly took maybe 30 photos
from different angles, and this
one is the best.

They caught their flight, and 5 . Millions of
air travelers make Iayovers every year, so Emmanuel
thought he could organize short guided trips into the

airport, takes them quickly around the sights and to a
restaurant, and then 5 .

In March 2015, he and business partner Anna Veyrenc

GEORGE pa 'r3eoR'eiNlA'

 ‘J *~‘,'.»é.,.

 

Have you ever noticed that you often ﬁnd the
same kinds of stores together on the same street?
Why are they together? Economics gives us one explanation...

Imagine a beach a half mile long, full of sunbathers. The
sun is shining, the water is warm. An ice-cream seller called
George arrives. Where does he put his ice«cream cart?
Obviously, 1 _, where the sunbathers can easily
walk to him and buy some ice—cream.

 

Later that day, a second ice-cream seller, Georgina. arrives.
George and Georgina talk for a while and decide that the
best solution is this: 2 , and they each put their
ice-cream cart in the middle of their half.

 

In zone A of the beach, the customers go to George, and in
zone B they go to Georgina. This is good for the customers.
because nobody needs to walk more than 1,300 feet for
some ice-cream.

But George isn’t happy - he only has 50% of the customers
that he had before. So 3 .

 

Zone A is now bigger than zone B, and George has more
customers and makes more money, but some of his
customers need to walk 2,600 feet to get their ice-cream.

Of course, Georgina sees what George has done, and now

she isn’t happy — she’s going to lose money. So 4
and gets 50% of the customers again.

r..__._!

‘i
Illl lllill

 

The result is this:
— George and Georgina end up next to each other.
— They both get 50% of the customers.
— More customers need to walk further for some ice—crearn.

So, what's good for businesses isn't always good lot customers.

A boring weekend?
Don’t tell anybody!

A new survey of 2,000 adults has shown
that 20% of the respondents tell lies
about their weekends on social media.

he survey, by a travel website, shows that

people invent stories to make their lives
appear more interesting than they really are.
Psychoiogist Judi James, one of the organizers of
the survey, said, "When some peopte read their
friends’ posts and see their photos on Facebook,
Twitter, and lnstagram, they begin to feeljeatous
of them. They think that their friends are having
a much more exciting life. So they invent details
about their own weekend.”

One of the main reasons people give for inventing
these stories is to have something to talk about
on Monday morning at work or at school. This is
because they don't want other people to think
that they have a boring life. The most popular
lies people tell are that they went to a party or
went away for the weekend, and 3% of people
even put on a fake tan on Sunday night to make
their colleagues think they went to the beach
for the weekend. One out of ten people invents a
romantic getaway with their partner.

People aged 18 to 24 are the ones who most often
tell lies on social media and men lie more often
than women. Only 20% of people interviewed said
that they always told the truth in posts.

Judi James said, “Social media is becoming
increasingly important in our lives, and it seems
were living one {ife online and another in reality."
So when you are feelingjealous on a Saturday
night because your best friend is having a
romantic dinner with her boyfriend, stop and ask
yourself, "ls she really there, or is she just sitting
at home feeling bored like me?”

Q 0 0 new words

 

Every three months the OED (Oxford English

Dictionary) publishes updates to its online
dictionary. One recent update contained 900 new
words. new expressions. or new meanings tor existing
words. But where do they all come from?

Everyone knows the English language is changing.

New words are created in many diﬁerent ways. We
can make a new word by combining two words, like
gastropub (gcrstronomy + pub) or vlog (video + biog)
Sometimes we put two words together in a new way, for
example road rage or settle stick.

We also ﬁnd that nouns can change into verbs. Take
the word text. Text was always a noun (from about
1369, according to the OED), but it is now very common
as a verb, to text somebody. Other new words already
existed but with a diﬁerent meaning. For example,
tweet was the noise that a bird makes, but now we use
it more often (as a verb or a noun) tor a message that
people put on the social—networklng site Twitter.

Another way in winch we make new words is by
“adopting” words from foreign languages, like barista or
latte (imported from Italian when coffee bars became
really popular in the 19905).

A lot of new words come from the names of brands or
cornpanies, for example we Slrype each other and we
google information. We also need more general words
to describe new technology or new gadgets: wt-ﬂ,
ringtone, and smcrrtphone are some examples.

The invention of new words is not a new phenomenon.
The word brunch (breakfast + lunch) ﬁrst appeared in
1896, newspaper (news + paper) in 1667. and English
speakers started to use the word caié (from French) in
the late 19th century. The diﬂerence now is how quickly
new words and expressions enter the language and
how quickly we start to use and understand them.

a Look at the cartoon in the article of a girl who
has an exam the next day. Do you think she is an
optimist or a pessimist?

b Read the article and check. What is "defensive
pessimism"?

 
why negative thinking
can be positive

Everybody thinks that it’s better to be an optimist man a

pessimist (even pessimists think it, of course). People always

say “Cheer up. Don’t worry, be happy. Smile.” But in fact there's

a kind of pessimism — called “defensive pessimism" — that can
05 lead to very positive results, according to Julie K. Norem, a

professor of psychology at Wellesley College, Massachusetts.

“Defensive pessimism is a strategy used in speciﬁc situations

to manage anxiety, fear, and worry,” says Norem. Studies show

that 30 to 35 percent of Americans use it to help them in their
10 lives, and they're often very successful people.

Defensive pessimists think about future situations and
prepare for them by imagining all the things that can go
wrong. For example, if a defensive pessimist has an important
exam, they think this:

 
 
  
 
 

 
 
  
 

I'LL 1'-{EL
1imzsT\'
or. I-uman’

    

‘'8 MY PENCIL
HILL BREHK

     

15 Then they look at each possible problem and plan how to
avoid it. So for the exam situation, they go to bed early and
have a good night’s sleep; they ﬁnd out in advance exactly
where the exam is; they eat a good breakfast, and take lots of
pens and pencils, and a bottle of water; and they leave home

20 early. That puts them in control, and it means that the exam
will be better than for an optimist, who just thinks, “Oh,
everything will be ﬁne!" Because sometimes everything goes
wrong, and it’s good to be prepared.

c Complete these sentences from the article with
the same word.

1 I'll go to the place.
2 Sometimes everything goes

d What do these sentences mean?

1 There's something wrong with the printer.
2 I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
3 Our trip was fine, nothing went wrong.

Read the article again. Then look at the things a
defensive pessimist thinks about catching a flight.
What can he do to avoid these problems?

The woman who inspired
“I have a dream"

/‘ , Ir-

Mahalia Jackson was a musical legend who helped to
bring gospel music from the church to large audiences.
She was Aretha Frank1in’s mentor, and in 1961 she was the
first gospel singer to win a Grammy Award. She was also
an important member of the civil rights movement in the
US, and she was a close friend of Martin Luther King, Jr.

Mahalia often went with King on civil rights
demonstrations and marches, including into the most
hostile parts of the south, and she sang at the events. As
a host from National Public Radio said, “Her voice became
the soundtrack of the civil rights movement."

On August 28th, 1963, there was a famous march in

Washington. D.C., again st racism. Mahalia was with King,
who was going to give a ﬁve—minute speech. Before the day
itself, he and his advisers decided what he was going to say.

King began Speaking ‘ ‘ Tell them about the

to an audience of more _
than 250,000 people. But d1‘ 90111: M0Tt1H- T9"

towards the end, he felt
that his speech was not
going well. Suddenly Mahalia shouted, “Tell them about
the dream, Martin. Tell them about the dream." She knew
about it because she was at a previous event in Detroit, i.n
June of that year, where King talked about his dream for
African Americans. It was, in the words of King's adviser
Clarence Jones, “one of the worlds greatest gospel singers
shouting to one of the world's greatest preachers.” King
looked at Mahalia. Then he threw away his written speech,
and looked at the audience.

“I have a dream. . .1 have a dream that my four little children
will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by
the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. . 
And so he continued, and he gave one of the best—loved
speeches in American history.

1 E That's been true for a long time. In any city
around the world you can hear American tourists
asking for the restaurant menu in English.
Sometimes they try to say a couple of phrases in the
local language, but they stop making an eﬁort as
soon as they discover that the waiter knows a little
English. Some Americans who live abroad often
spend all their time with other Americans, and
never learn the language at all.

2 Many Americans think "I don't have to learn

a foreign language because everyone speaks
English nowadays.” This is partly true. In many
multinational companies, for example, employees
have to speak English because it is the company’s
official language of communication.

3 Most American children only have to learn a
language until they are 14 or 15. After that, they don’t
have to continue if they don’t want to. Many young
people say that they don't want to continue studying
a foreign language because "it’s too difficult."

4 A newspaper decided to ﬁnd out by sending
Max, one of its journalists, on an intensive
language course. He then had to go to the country
and do some “tests” to see if he could "survive" in
different situations.

5 “Id like to visit Puerto Rico and Latin America
in the future. If I go, I don’t want to be the typical
American who expects everyone else to speak
English." He did a one-month intensive course at a
language school in Washington, D.C.

6 When his course ended, he went to San Juan,
Puerto Rico for the weekend to take his tests. A
teacher called Nilda met him there and gave him a
score out of ten for each test and then a ﬁnal score
for everything.

B Murphy's Law

READING

If you're waiting in a long line at the supermarket
and you change to a different line, what will
usually happen?

Read the first two paragraphs of the article and
check. Who was Murphy? What is his "law"?

'”‘é'£‘.f'g'Bi'~i§-o..g...

If you’re in a long line at the supermarket and
you change to another line that is moving more
quickly, what will happen? The line you were in
before will suddenly start moving faster. What will
happen if you take your umbrella because you think
it’s going to rain later? It wont rain, of course. It will
only rain if you forget to take your umbrella. These
are examples of Murphy's Law, which says, “if there is
something that can go wrong, it will go wrong.”

Murphy's Law took its name from Captain Edward
Murphy. an American aerospace engineer from the
1940s. He was trying to improve safety for pilots ﬂying
military planes. Not surprisingly. he got a reputation for
always thinking of the worst thing that could happen

in every situation. Here are some more examples of

“I’ve found where she lives,” said the detective quietly.
“Here is the address.”
Hartley took the piece of paper. On it were the words
“Vivienne Arlington, No. 341 East 49th Street.”

05 “She moved there a week ago,” said the detective. “I
can follow her if you want. It will only cost you $7 a clay
and expenses...”

“No, thank you,” interrupted Hartley. “1 only wanted
the address. How much is it?”

10 “One day’s work," said the detective. “Ten dollars.”

Hartley paid the man. Then he left his ofﬁee and
took a tram to Broadway. After walking a short distance
he arrived at the building that he was looking for. He
went up the stairs, into her apartment, and saw her

15 standing by the window.

Vivienne was about twenty—one. Her hair was red
gold, and her eyes were sea-blue. She was wearing a
white top and a dark skirt.

“Vivienne,” said Hartley angrily, “you didn’t answer

address! Why didn’t you answer me? You knew I was
waiting to see you and hear from you.”

The girl looked out the window dreamily.

“Mr. Hartley,” she said slowly, “I don’t know what to
say to you. I understand all the advantages of your offer,
and sometimes I feel sure that I could be happy with you.
But, then sometimes I am less sure. I was born a city girl,
and I am not sure that I would enjoy living a quiet life in the
suburbs.”

“My dear girl,” said Hartley, “You will have everything
that you want. You can come to the city for the theater, for
shopping, and to visit your friends as often as you want. You
can trust me, can’t you?”

“I can trust you completely,” she said, smiling at him. “I
know you are the kindest of men, and that the girl who you
get will be very lucky. I heard all about you when I was at
the Montgomerys’.”

“Ah!” exclaimed Hartley, “I remember so well the evening
I first saw you at the Montgomerys’. I will never forget that
dinner. Come on, Vivienne, promise me. I want you. Nobody
else will ever give you such a happy home.”

Vivienne didn’t answer. Suddenly Hartley was
suspicious. “Tell me, Vivienne, is there,” he asked, “is there
someone else?”

“You shouldn’t ask that, Mr. Hartley,” she said. “But
I will tell you. There is one other person — but I haven’t
promised him anything.”

“Vivienne,” said Hartley masterfully, “You must be mine.”

Vivienne looked him in the eye.

“Do you think for one moment," she said calmly, “that
I could come to your home while Heloise is there?”

CAN YOU understand this text?

a Read the article. Does it give you...?

1 explanations and tips about waiting in line
2 the history of waiting in line
3 stories about waiting in line

  

HOW TO BE A

Do you know why the lines at the other
checkouts in the supermarket always seem
to move faster than yours? A new book by David
Andrews, Why Does the Other Line Always Move
Faster?, has the answer: because you only notice
how fast the other lines are moving when yours

is moving slowly. If your line moves fast, then you
won't notice the slower lines at all, because you're
busy unloading your shopping cart, putting things
into bags, and paying.

        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 

Of course, another part of the answer is simple
probability. If there are three lines in the
supermarket and you join the middle one, there is
a two in three chance that one of the other lines
will be the fastest, whereas yours only has a one in
three chance.

   

S0 HOW CAN YOU BEA ?
According to Andrews. this is what gou should do:

  
 
    
  
   
   
 
   
 
 

1 CHOOSE A |.lHE THAT HAS MORE HEN
IN IT. Men are less patient than women,
and sometimes give up and leave the
line if its moving very slowlg.

2 CHOOSE A LIHE ON THE LEFT. Most
people are right-handed, and choose
lines on the right, so lines on the left
are often shorter.

DON'T USE THE EXPRESS LANE. Lots of
people with a few items can be slower
than a few people with lots of items.

 

4 IF YOU CAN. CHOOSE A CHECKOUT
THAT IS ‘CASH ONLY.‘ Using cash is
usually quickerthan paging by card.

5 DON'T THINK TOO MUCH! Sometimes
it's bestjust to join the line with the
fewest people.

 
   
 

b Read the article again. Match the sentence halves.

‘l

"""fl3Cl_0U'W 0‘U1-D-La.!l\J

If your line moves fast, '

if there are three lines,

If there are a lot of women in the line,

if you choose a line on the left,

If there are a lot of people in the express lane,
If people pay cash,

yours will probably not be the fastest.

it will move more slowly than a normal lane.

you'll be too busy to notice the other lines.

This phobia is very common in young children. but adults suffer
from it, too. Many are especially afraid of having vaccinations or
blood tests. Comment

4

This fear affects nearly one in every 20 adults. People with
this phobia usually avoid tall buildings, skiing, or standing on
balconies. Comment

5

This phobia affects many people, but women more than
men. These people feel very anxious or scared if they
are in a noisy place where there are a lot of people. for

C m I thought i was the only person that had this fear! l'm
OK with the small ones, but l’m terriﬁed of the big

ones. l'm OK if they aren't close to me. but as soon as they
start ﬂying near me! run away. I like looking at pictures of
them because they can be beautiful, but if they ﬂy towards
me, especially towards my face, I panic. Mina

D I suffer from this phobia. and what works best for
me, ifl know that l'm going to be in a situation

where there'll be a lot of people, is to arrive early. Then
other people arrive little by little, and that helps me. The
worst thing is walking into a place that is already full of
people. Simon

E I've had this phobia for about 20 years. It started

dream where l was in an apartment building high up on a

I think we should open up men’s
soccer to women. Then we could
compare, person to person, how well
each player performs, and teams could
be made up of the best players, both men
and women. That’s true of most team
sports, actually.

Women’s sports that are identical to
men’s sports — soccer and basketball,
for example — will never be as
popular as men’s, because men are
faster, stronger, and more athletic.
On the other hand, sports that
highlight the strengths of female ‘
athletes — tennis, gymnastics,
ice skating — are popular. But
1't’s interesting that none of those
are team sports.

Brandi, I think you’re right about the
difference between team and individual
sports. When I watch the Olympics (winter
and summer], I enjoy the Women’s and men’s
individual events equally. The women probably
run / swim I ski a little slower than the men, but
I can’t really tell, and it’s just as exciting.
Lynn228 3:12 pm

Most people want to watch the best sports people
perform at the highest level. If you compare top
male and female athletes, physical differences
mean that women are always inferior athletes

to men.

SirnonB 12:53 pm

 
   
       
    
 

 
 

In men’s soccer, the players fall all the time and
act like babies. The women don’t do that. I’ve
read research that says that women hardly ever
pretend to be hurt. And when they are hurt, they
get up again 30 seconds faster than men.

VOCABULARY 8: GRAMMAR phrasal verbs

Wake up, get up, go out, give up, etc., are common phrasal
verbs (verbs with a preposition or adverb).

Sometimes the meaning of the two separate words can help
you guess the meaning of the phrasal verb, e.g., go out.
Sometimes the meaning of the two words does not help you,

e.g., give up.

Look at some things that Ella and Peter say. With a partner,
explain what the highlighted verbs mean.

1 "The alarm goes off at 2:35."

2 "I wake up on time because I have an alarm that repeats."

3 "I get up at about 4:45."

4 ”During the week we don't go out at all."

5 "I really love my breakfast show, and I never want to give it up."

The hardest lesson to learn in sports is how to lose like
a true sportsperson, without blaming your defeat on
others. Here are some famous moments when losing
was just too hard...

In the 1982 German Grand Prix, Nelson Piquet was
winning the race. He was trying to pass Eliseo Salazar
(who was last in the race), but Salazar dic|n’t let him go
past him, so Pique’: crashed into Salazar. Piquet jumped
out of his car and started trying to hit and kick Salazar
(without much succassi).

South Korean soccer player Ahn Jung-Hwan scored the
goal that sent Italy out of the 2002 World Cup when they
beat them 2-1. But Jung-Hwan also played for the Italian
soccer team Perugia. After the game, the president of
the club, Luciano Gaucci, announced that the player's
contract would not be renewed. “That gentleman will
never set foot in Perugia again." Gaucci said. "I have no
intention of paying a salary to somebody who has ruined
Italian soccer.” Gaucci later apologized, but Ahn Jung-
Hwan left the club and never went back to an Italian club.

In the 2003 Track and Field World Championship, the
100-meter runner Jon Drummond was disqualiﬁed for a
false start. Drummond lay down on the track and began I
to cry. Two hours later his coach told reporters, "He’s  ‘
still crying. we're making him drink

water because he's becoming W

   

dehydrated."

In the 2008 Beijing Olympics,
Angel Mates of Cuba was
trying to win a bronze medal
in tae kwon do when the
referee disqualiﬁed him for

a technical error. Mates was
furious, and after several minutes
of arguing he kicked the referee
in the head, and then attacked a
Swedish judge. He was immediately
banned from all competitions for life.

  
 
    
   
 
   
 

In 2016, at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
the German men's soccer team lost to the host
nation in the ﬁnal. Brazil won their first ever Olympic
gold medal in the event and the local fans were delighted.
As they celebrated, one very disappointed German player,
Robert Bauer, decided to show seven ﬁngers to the fans.

to remind them of the time Germany beat Brazil 7—1 in the
2014 World Cup semi—ﬁnal.

a Look at the photos. One of them is of identical
twins, but two of them are of complete strangers.
Which one do you think is of twins?

b Read about the project Twin Strangers and check
your answers.

wo women recently met by chance at Bremen

University, in Germany. One was English, and one
was Irish, and they were both on Erasmus scholarships.
Nothing unusual there, except for one thing. The two
girls look identical. Their hair is the same color and
length, they're the same age and size, and when you see
them together, in the photo they put on social media,
you would think that they were identical twins. In fact,
Cordelia Roberts and Ciara Murphy are unrelated.

It seems that it is not uncommon for people who are
unrelated to look almost identical. Niamh Geaney, from
Dublin, and two friends were so interested in trying to
find their “twins” that they set up an online project called
Twin Strangers. Very quickly, Niamh found a remarkably
simiiar-looking stranger who lived just a few miles away.
It's perhaps not so surprising since both young women
look typically Irish, with dark hair and very pale skin,
but then Niamh found
another lookalike —
Luisa Guizzardi, who is
from Genoa in Italy!

Once upon a time, in a small town in Eastern
Europe, there was a man who loved gossiping.
Every day he used to sit with his friends and talk
about other people. “Can you believe she did that?”
"Can you believe he said that?” “Did you see what
she was wearing?” And his friends told their wives,
who told their neighbors, who told their friends.

Some of the stories were true and some were not,

but they all went around the town.

One day a wise old woman in the town asked to %

speak to the man. When he arrived, she gave him 
a feather pillow. “Take the pillow to the top of the F
hill, then cut it open, and release all the feathers,” 3
she said. "But why?” he asked. “Just do as I say,” she
answered, “and come back tomorrow.” So the man
went to the top of the hill. He cut open the pillow.

All the feathers flew out, and the wind carried them
in all directions.

The next day he went back to see the wise woman
and he told her that he had done what she wanted.
“Good,” she replied. “Now I want you to go back up
the hill with the empty pillow and reﬁll it with the
feathers.” “But that’s impossible,” said the man.

Stop the plane -
we want to get on!

 

n Italian couple ran out onto the runway of

Malta’s international airport to stop a Flyanair
jet from leaving for Italy without them, a Maltese
court heard on Thursday.

Matteo Clementi, 26, and Enrica Apollonio, 23, got
stuck in terrible trafﬁc on their way to the airport on
Wednesday. when they arrived, the gate was closed
and they were not allowed to board their ﬂight back
to Italy. They went to the next gate, forced open a
security door, and ran toward the plane. The engines
were running and the stairs had been removed, but
the couple tried signaling to the pilots to let them get
on. However, they were not allowed to board and were
arrested by security staff.

A lawyer defending them in court said that
Wednesday was Enrica’s 23rd birthday. She had
wanted to celebrate it with her family and friends in
Italy. Instead, she spent the evening in prison, and
the couple was ﬁned €2,329.

From  to
 in 30 minutes

man who found $20 on the street near San
Francisco International Airport used it to play
the California lottery and won $1 million, lottery
spokesman Greg Parashak said on Monday.
Hubert Tang used the $20 to buy two lottery

scartch-"off cards at a store near the airport on

Wednesday and won the top prize with one of

them, Parashalc told us.

Tang said, “I scratched off the ticket outside of

the store. I told my friend who I was with that I

didn't know if-it was real, but I thought I had just

Won a million dollars.” Tang, who works as a waiter

at the airport, had not played the lottery for the

last ten years. He said that he planned to continue

working and had not decided how to spend 1
the money. But he said that ' '
he might leave $20 bills

in different places so that
other people could ﬁnd
them and be lucky like him.

9A WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO? Student A

a Read the answers to in the city.

IN THE CITY

1 The answer Is b. Dogs like to attack any part of you that is moving,
usually hands or arms. It is also dangerous to turn your book on the
dog. You shouldn't look the dog in its eyes because this will make
it angry. Shouting “ciown' or “go away" at the dog will not work
because clogs usually only react to their master's voice.

2 The answer is a. Wasps and bees will usually fly out of an open
window. but don't wave your hands around because they follow
movement and might try to sting you. And you must not hit the
wasp or bee because this will make them very angry. Of course.
as soon as you can, you should stop the car and open the doors.

b Tell B and C the correct answers, and why the other ones
are wrong.

c Listen to B and C tell you about the other sections (in the

the bread and cakes between 3:00 and 8:30 — that’s when I open the shop.

I usually ﬁnish work at about 3:00 in the afternoon, so I'm often at
work for about 12 hours. I go to bed at 8:30. Because we go to bed so
early, during the week we don’t go out at all. I sometimes go out on a

close, you can probably swim to the shore without attracting its

attack you. Don't shout because shouting will provoke the shark

The Peter Gordon Breakfast Show starts at exactly 6:00, so I need
to be at work at 5:30 a.m on weekday mornings. I'm lucky because I live
very close to the studio — its only three to four minutes by car — so I get up
at about 4:45. I wake up on time because I have an alarm that repeats, and
I wear a Fitbit that vibrates as well. When that goes off, I know that I really
have to get upl

For the First few minutes I feel a little sleepy. but then I wake up quickly.

I choose my clothes the night before. and that way everythings ready. I
have a cup of tea, and then I leave the house at about 5:15. I have breakfast
during the radio show while lm playing music — maybe a smoothie and
some cereal. I'm a director of the radio station. so after my show I usually
work in the office until late afternoon ~ its a long working day!

I go to bed late. usually at about 11:00. I find it very difﬁcult to go to bed
early, it's always been a problem for me. So I only get about ﬁve or six hours
of sleep — but thats enough for me. Because I get up early, I try not to go
out with friends during the week I only go to necessary events. like work
events. Weekends are different!

Iknowl get up really early, but I dont
want to change my hours because I
really love my breakfast show, and I
never want to give it up.

6 A BIOGRAPHY

a Read the biography of Matt Damon.
Then cover the text and try to remember
three things about him.

b Put the verbs in parentheses in the simple
past or present perfect.

D Writing a biography ~— use of tenses
If you write a biography of a person who is
dead, the verbs will all be in the simple past.

if the person is alive, all finished actions will be
in the simple past (such as the person's early
life, e.g., He was born, He went to college,

etc., or specific actions in their life, e.g., He got
married, He moved to another country, etc.).

However, you must use the present perfect

for unfinished actions that started in the past
and are still true now (and which might change),
e.g., He has lived in Los Angeles since his
wedding. (= he lives there now)

He has appeared in a lot of movies. (= he might
appear in more in the future)

Use the simple present (or present continuous)
to talk about the present day, e.g., He lives in Los
Angeles. Hes working on a new movie.

c You're going to write a biography of
someone you know, or a_famous person,
who is still alive. Plan and make notes for
each paragraph before you begin.

Paragraph 1

My name's Elspeth. I'm 25, I'm a journalist, and

I'm single. It's not easy to meet people. So, who

can help me? My mother...and a dating app. My

favorite dating app, called Tinder, shows you
photos of possible partners with a little information
about them. You look at the photos and swipe,
swipe, swipe. Swipe right if you like them, and
swipe left...welI...swipe left if you don't. If a guy
likes you and you like him, you have a match. Then
you can start messaging the person and from this,
romance foI|ows...or so they say. I've tried it, but
with no success. So I decide to give my mother my
phone. She can swipe all the men she likes, and
then look at my matches and choose the people

that she likes the best. I've promised to go on a

date with the men she chooses.

.»]"r',_~ ;- .

Date 1 My first date is with a nice guy named John.
I sit at a table in a café and wait for him to arrive.

An old man walks towards the table, and for two
awful seconds I think it's all a terrible mistake, but
he walks past and then my date arrives. He's very
tall, six feet, two inches. Good job, Mom! I'm tall
myself, so I always look for tall men, as my mom
knows well. We start chatting, and it's all very
easy. Mom has good taste. He's a teacher. We
get along well and it's a fun date, but sadly there
isn't a spark. So I try again.

Date 2 I arrive a little early again, and I sit there
waiting for Sebastian to arrive. Suddenly, I realize
that I can't remember anything at all about
him, not even where he's from. Then he comes
through the door: tall, dark, and handsome.
"Mom, you're amazing," l say to myself. He's
from Argentina, but he lives in the US. He's a real
gentleman. At the end of the evening, he asks for
a second date. Mom is very happy. I agree to the
date, but I don't really think it's going to work.

Date 3 Date number three is George. He suggests
a restaurant near the river. I arrive early — I'm
definitely the most punctual person in the world.
I stand outside, very confused: the restaurant
is closed. Fora moment lthink Mom finally got
it wrong_ gut a few minutes later he arrives — he
just didn't know the restaurant was ciosed. We
go somewhere else and start chatting. He tells
me he works in IT and is from just outside the
city. This guy is a lot of fun. He's very relaxed and
interesting — he's traveled a lot. He tells a lot of
funny stories. It's all going well, and I'm getting
very enthusiastic, when my phone pings.

2;,‘ ' . .

Johannes Vermeer was a seventeenth—century

painter from the city of Delft in Holland. He mainly

painted the people and things he saw around

him: the rooms in his house, the people who lived

or worked there (usually women), and the things

they did every day. For example, in his work you

will see women who are playing music, reading or
writing letters, or working in the kitchen. Vermeer
was especially good at painting light coming into

a room through windows. Partly forthis reason,

people often describe his work as being like

photography or film — his paintings can seem very

"real."

This painting, The Milkmaid, is one of these very

"photographic" images. The woman, a maid or a

servant, is pouring milk into a bowl. Perhaps she's

making a bread and milk pudding, because there
are pieces of broken bread on the table. Nobody
knows if the woman he painted was a real servant
or a model. However, most people think Vermeer
usually painted his wife, his daughter, and his
servant, not models. A famous book and movie,

Calied Girl with a Pearl Earring, is an imaginary

story about Vermeer and his relationship with his

young servant, inspired by one of his best-known
paintings.

People admired Vermeer's paintings a lot in his

lifetime, but he was never rich. There are two

reasons for this. First, because he painted very
slowly. Today there are only about 34 paintings that
we can be sure are by him. Second, because he
used very expensive paints. The blue paint he used
for the milkmaid's apron was made of Iapis lazuli,
which was a very expensive stone.

People loved this painting from the very beginning,

and although it is very small, only 18 by 16 inches,

20 years after Vermeer died, somebody bought

the painting for 175 Dutch guilders. That was an

enormous amount of money for the time.

Marta's story This happened two years ago. I'm
Spanish, but I was in Ireland at the time because
I had a job in Dublin. Some friends ofmine who
lived in Lyon, in France, invited me to come and
stay, so I decided to take a short vacation, a
long weekend, from Friday to Tuesday. I looked
for cheap flights, but I couldn't find any direct
ones. The only thing I could find was Ryanair
from Dublin to Brussels and then Air France from
Brussels to Lyon.

Anyway, the flight to Brussels was fine, and
when I arrived, I went to the gate for my next
flight to Lyon, but then when I needed to show
my boarding pass and my ID, I couldn't find my
ID card. I looked everywhere, in my bag, in my
suitcase, but it wasn't there. The people at the
gate were very nice and they made some phone
calls, but nobody could find it. So, they told me
to wait in a small room and I sat there for more
than an hour, and my flight to Lyon left without
me.

It was awful — I cried — I was so stressed and
unhappy. In the end, a police officer came and he
said that I couldn't go to France because I didn't
have any ID- the only place I could go was to
Spain to get a new ID card! I waited another five
or six hours for the flight to Madrid, feeling very
depressed.

So, I never took my vacation! I spent the
weekend in Madrid getting my new ID card!

1 Anya This is me and my mom in York. It was my
first semester at college, and she came to visit
me, and I took her on a tour around the city.
Friend is that. uh, the cathedral there?

Anya Yes - well, it's called York Minster, but it's
realty a cathedral.

2 Anya And this one's on the beach with my
boyfriend, Ollie. I was staying with him on spring
break, and he took me to the beach and we went
for a walk.

Friend It looks windy!
Anya Yes, it was really windy and cold. I think we
were the only people on the beach!

3 Friend Nice photo! i like the mustache.

Anya Yeah, that's me and my friend Maisie. We
were taking a music class — I take it twice a year,
and this was at the party at the end of the class.
Friend Why the mustaches and the picture
frame?

Anya There was this corner that the teachers
made where people could take funny photos
with the big frame, and hats and mustaches and
things.

4 Anya OK, this one is me and two of my best
friends — we were at school together. One of
them, Libby, the one on my right, has a house by
the river, and we went there in September before
we all went to college.

5 Friend That's a nice photo. In Rome, I guess?
Anya Yes, I was there fora vacation with my
mom the summer before I went to college. She
took this when we were visiting the Colosseum —
as you can see.

6 Friend That's your mom again, isn't it?

Anya Yes, that's her and her partner, and my
sister Roz. It was Christmas and Roz and I were
staying with Mom and David and we decided to
go for a walk. It was nice weather for December,
cold but it wasn't raining and it was good
exercise after an enormous Christmas lunch.
Friend Are any of the photos selfies?

Anya Yes, that one's a selfie, the one of the four
of us, and also the one of me and Mom in York
and the one with my boyfriend on the beach!

Anna Hello, Mr. Bevan. I'm Anna, yourtour guide.

Jake Hi. Please, call me Jake.

Anna OK, Jake. Nice to meet you. How was the
flight? Are you tired?

Jake No, I'm fine.

Anna Great. Let's go to the parking lot. is it your
first time here?

Jake Yeah. iwas in Europe when I was a student,
but somehow I never got here.

Anna And yourfinal destination is London, is that
right?

Jake Yes. I'm going to give a talk at a conference
in Oxford.

Anna So work, not pleasure?

Jake Yes— well, maybe some pleasure, too. I have a
friend, well, an ex-girlfriend really, who l was with
when I was a student. She's British — she lives in
Oxford — and we're planning to meet up.

Anna That's nice! OK, so now I'm going to tell you
a little about our tour today. We're going to drive
to the city — it takes about 45 minutes — and then
we're going to start at the Colosseum.

Jake Great. I've always wanted to see it.

Anna And then we're going to visit the Forum.
After that, we're going to see the Pantheon « one
ofthe oldest buildings in the city.

Jake Wow.

Anna So then we are very close to the Via del
Corso, where all the best stores are. Would you
like to maybe do some shopping?

Jake Well, I'd like to see the stores, but I'm
probably not going to buy anything.

Anna Maybe a little present, a present for your
friend in Oxford?

Jake Well, maybe.

Anna And then I'm sure you're going to be
hungry, so I'm going to take you to a really nice
restaurant for lunch. We can have pizza, or a
good carbonara, a gelato — an ice cream, that
is. Our typical dishes, but I promise you, very
different from Italian food in America.

Jake Sounds great. And then back to the airport,

I guess?

Anna That's right. We need to allow time for that.

Jake Yes, I don't want to miss my flight.

Anna Don't worry. We do this tour every day — and
nobody has ever missed their flight.

Jake is it going to be very hot today?

Anna No, not too hot. It's going to be nice, about
7] degrees.

Jake Perfect. It's going to be a great day.

Anna Here we are. If you canjust wait a minute
while I pay forthe parking. Oh, Mr. Bevan — Jake
e is this yours?

Jake My passport! Thanks, Anna. Typical me. I
always lose things when I'm traveling.

Sarah Hello?

Jake Sarah?

Sarah Hi, Jake.

Jake Hi. Great to hear your voice! How are things?

Sarah Fine, fine. How was the trip? When did you
arrive in the UK?

Jake Last night. The trip was fine. I got a cheap
flight with Alitalia, but it meant a long layover in
Rome, but I went on a guided tour and I had a
great time.

Sarah That sounds like fun. What did you think of
Rome?

Jake Fantastic. I loved it. So when can we meet?

Sarah I'm afraid I'm really busy this week. The only
possible clay for me is Tuesday. I'm going to
London from Wednesday to Friday...

Jake Tuesday. Let me look at my calendar.

Sarah Wow, Jake, you put things on your calendar!

You're much more organized than when we were
going out.

Jake Well, I'm better than I was. But I almost lost
my passport when I was in Rome. OK, Tuesday.
I'm not free in the evening. I'm having dinner with
Mark Taylor, my old professor. Do you remember
him? It's at 7:30. I can't change that. How about
lunch?

Sarah It depends on the time. A late lunch would
be OK, around i:45?

Jake The problem is I'm giving my talk at 2:00. And
I'm having a breakfast meeting at 8:15 with some
colleagues.

Sarah Well, morning coffee or tea in the afternoon
then. What are you doing then?

Jake Let's see. ..I'm going to a talk about climate
change at 4:00. So, I think maybe morning coffee
is best. And then we can try to arrange another
time.

Sarah OK. There's a nice coffee shop on the main
street called The Grand Cafe. Meet there at
11:00?

Jake Perfect. I'm really looking forward to it.

Sarah Me too. Bye.

Host OK. It begins with B. It's an adjective for a

I'm lazy, but I like living in a clean, neat home.
Maybe you're the same. It doesn't matter if you

live by yourself, with a partner, or with a group of
friends. You're always going to have to do some
housework. Learn a few cleaning tricks and you can
have a clean home — and still have plenty of time to
relax and do nothing.

Tip 1. Clean quickly, but often.

Clean forjust ten minutes twice a day. This gives
you time to, for example, load the dishwasher and
do one other thing like vacuuming. Set an alarm on
your phone to motivate yourself.

Tip 2. Keep cleaning products in the right place.
Put cleaning products near the place where

you need them. Keep bathroom cleaners in the
bathroom, keep garbage bags by the can, and keep
dishwasher detergent on top of the dishwasher.
Sometimes you don't clean if you can't immediately
see what you need, and you don't want to look for it.
Tip 3. Clean the microwave regularly.

You probably use this every day and it gets dirty
quickly, believe me. But cleaning it is super easy.
All you need to do is pour a little water into a
microwave—safe bowl, slice a lemon in halfand
squeeze thejuice into the water. Then, put the two
halves ofthe lemon in the bowl and microwave on
high for three minutes. Leave the door closed for
another five minutes, and then clean the inside with
a cloth.

Tip 4. Use your dishwasher to clean other things.

If you have a dishwasher, it's probably already your
best friend. But did you know that it can clean much
more than just kitchen things? You can use it to

clean all kinds of things made of plastic like toys, or
even flip—flops or other plastic shoes, and also for
things made of metal like tools, or keys.

Tip 5. Tell people to take off their shoes when they
come in.

If you hate vacuuming, but you also hate the floor
because you don't do the vaccuming, there's an
easy solution — tell your housemates and guests to
take off their shoes at the front door. And if they
forget or refuse, give them the vacuum cleaner.

Tip 6. Use your socks to clean the floor.

If you have a hard floor, like wood or stone, for
example, make your socks work for you. Take your
shoes off, and slide across a different part of your
floor each time you move across it. it'll soon be
completely clean. Then, just throw your socks in the
washing machine.

And finally tip 7. Listen to music while you clean.
Sometimes you really need to do some housework
that you hate, like ironing or cleaning the bathroom.
Put on your favorite playlist and focus on the music,
not the boring housework.

And one last word. Many people say that lazy
people are often the best employees because
they find the most efficient way to complete a

task. That's the way you need to think when you're
cleaning. Good luck!

1 I spend much less time shopping — that is going
to real stores — than in the past because now I
get so much online. I buy most of my food online
— everything except fresh things like meat or fruit
and vegetables. Uh, I get books from Amazon.

I buy a lot of clothes online. And it's so quick
online. You don't have to go there, you don't
spend as long looking for what you want. It's just
much, much quicker. I definitely prefer it.

2 One of the things that has changed for me is
getting to work. It takes me much longer now
because I bike. A few years ago I drove, I took
the car, but then I decided to bike, not always
because I enjoy it, but because I know it's
healthier. It takes me about half an hour to get
to work now. Actually, when the weather's good
I really enjoy it, but when it's raining orjust cold
and horrible, I get up and l think oh no!

3 I definitely spend a lot more time cooking now
than I did before, I think because, uh, about a
year ago I started living with my boyfriend. When
I lived alone, in the evening I was tired and ljust
got some take—out, or made something really
quickly, orjust had some bread and cheese or
whatever was in the refrigerator, whatever was
easier. But when you have someone else in the
house you feel more like cooking. And also my
boyfriend's a vegetarian, so it's a little more
complicated to do something very quick. So,
before i spent about 20 minutes a clay and now
I spend about an hour. But I'm very happy with
that, lenjoy it.

4 I probably spend about the same amount of time

working as I did three years ago. I'm a freelance

writer now and three years ago I had an office job
so I was doing, you know, 35 hours a week. Now
some weeks I probably work about 50 hours and
others 20 hours, but on average I think it's about
the same.

I definitely spend less time seeing friends

because two years ago we moved to the country

from the city— and most of ourfriends are in the
city and they're a long way away from us now.

Sometimes they come and spend the weekend

with us or we go and spend the weekend with

them, but on average I definiteiy spend less time
with them.

Interviewer Today, we're talking about a very
interesting experiment to find the most and
least honest cities in the world. It involved
journalists traveling to 16 cities and "losing" 12
wallets in each city, and then waiting to see how
many people returned them in each place. Our

Go online to listen to the audio and see all the Listening scripts

reporter, Oliver, has the results. So, Oliver, which
was the most honest city?

Oliver Well, in first place was Helsinki, in
Finland. People returned 11 of the I2 wallets.

A businessman who found the wallet in the
city's downtown said that Finnish people were
naturally honest. He said there was very little
corruption in Finland, and that people didn't
even drive through red traffic lightsl

Interviewer Really? And the least honest?

Oliver Well, I was very surprised by this, but the
least honest city, in 16th place, was Lisbon, in
Portugal. Only one person called to say they'd
found the wallet. And he wasn't Portuguese. He
was a 60-year-old tourist from Holland.

Interviewer Interesting! What other results
surprised you?

Oliver Well, I expected richer cities, cities with a
higher standard of living, to be more honest than
poorer ones, but this wasn't necessarily true. The
City that came in second in the experiment was
Mumbai, in India — people returned 9 out of the
12 wallets. One of them was a young mother. She
took it to a post office and she said, "I teach my
children to be honest, just like my parents taught
me."

Interviewer And which city came next?

Oliver Tied for third place were New York and
Budapest. People gave back eight wallets in both
places.

Interviewer And then?

Oliver Moscow and Amsterdam tied for fifth. in
both places, 7 out of 12 wallets were returned.
And people gave great reasons for returning
them. In Moscow, a woman said, "l think that
people need to help each other, and ifl can
make someone a little happier, I want to do it."
And in Amsterdam a man said, "My wife once
lost her wallet. It was found and returned. So, I
wanted to do the same."

Interviewer I notice London is on the list. How did
it do?

Oliver London was somewhere in the middie, tied
for ninth with Warsaw. Just five of the wallets
were returned in each place. Interestingly, one of
the people who returned a wallet in London was
a Polish woman. When she found the wallet, she
gave it to her boss. He — her boss — said to her,
"Ifyou find money, you can't be sure it belongs
to a rich man — it might be the last bit of money a
mother has to feed her family."

interviewer I think that's fantastic advice. So were
there any general conclusions? What did the
experiment prove?

Oliver 47 percent of the wallets were returned, so
that's almost half. And when we looked through
the results, we found that you couldn't predict
who was going to be honest or dishonest. There
was no common factor. Young people and old
people both kept or returned wallets; men
and women both kept or returned wallets; and
as I said before, it didn't make any difference
whether a city was rich or poor. So our conclusion
was that there are honest and dishonest people
everywhere.

At least half of your daily liquids should come

from water. About one-third (or three to four cups)
can come from coffee or tea — but with no sugar.
Low-fat milk can make up another 20 percent. If
you drink less milk, just try to get your calcium
from another type of food or drink, for example,
green vegetables. You can have one small glass of
fruit juice a day. Sports drinks are for athletes who
exercise more than an hour a day. You can drink a
glass or two if you exercise a lot. Diet drinks that
use artificial sweeteners are not good for you, but
up to one to two glasses a day is OK. But try Q to
have gm drinks with a lot of sugar, for example, soft
drinks like soda or sugary iced tea.

Presenter Today's topic is "positive thinking."
We all know that people who are positive enjoy
life more than people who are negative and
pessimistic. But scientific studies show that
positive people are also healthier. They get better
more quickly when they are sick, and they live
longer. A recent study has shown that people
who are optimistic and think positively live, on
average, nine years longer than pessimistic
people. So, let's hear what you, the listeners,
think. Do you have any ideas to help us be more
positive in our lives?

Host Our first caller this evening is Andy. Hi, Andy.
What's your tip for being positive?

Andy Hello. Well, I think it's very important to live
in the present and not in the past. Don't think
about mistakes you made in the past — you can't
change things now. The important thing is to
think about how you can do things better now
and in the future.

Host Thank you, Andy. And now we have another
caller. What's your name, please?

Julie Hi, my names Julie. My tip is think positive
thoughts, not negative ones. We all have
negative thoughts sometimes, but when we start
having them, we need to stop and try to change
them into positive ones. Like, if you have an
exam tomorrow and you start thinking, ’’I'm sure
I'll fail," then you'll fail the exam. So you need
to change that negative thought to a positive
thought. Just think to yourself, "I’Il pass." I do
this and it usually works.

Host Thank you, Julie. And our next caller is
Martin. Hi, Martin.

Martin Hi. My tip is don't spend a lot of time
following the news online or on TV. It's always
bad news and it just makes you feel depressed.
Read a book or listen to yourfavorite music
instead, and you won't feel so bad.

Host Thanks, Martin. Good tip! And our next caller
is Miriam. Miriam?

Miriam Hi.

Host Hi, Miriam. What's yourtip?

Miriam Every week, make a iist of all the good
things that happened to you, on your phone or
on a piece of paper. Then if you're feeling a little
sad or depressed, read the list and it'll make you
feel better.

Host Thanks, Miriam. And our last call is from
Michael. Hi, Michael. We're listening.

Michael Hi. I think it's good to try to use positive
language when you speak to other people. You
know, if your friend has a problem, don't say "I'm
sorry" or "Oh, you poor thing." Say something
positive like, "Don't worry! Everything'l| be OK."
That way, you'll make the other person think
more positively about their problem.

Host Thank you, Michael. Well, that's all we have
time for. A big thank you to all our callers.

Patient So what does it mean, Doctor?

Doctor Well, first the party. A party is a group of
people. This means that you're going to meet
a lot of people. I think you're going to be very
busy.

Patient At work?

Doctor Yes, at worIc...you work in an office, I think?

Patient Yes, that's right.

Doctor i think the party means you're going to
have a lot of meetings. Maybe in the future you'll
have a meeting with your boss, about a possible
promotion?

Patient Well, it's possible. I hope so...What about
the garden and the flowers? Do they mean
anything?

Doctor Yes. Flowers are a positive symbol. So, the
flowers mean that you are feeling positive about
the future. So perhaps you already knew about
this possible promotion?

Patierit No, ldidn't. But it's true, I am very happy
at work and I feel very positive about my future.
That's not where my problems are. My problems
are with my love life. Does my dream tell you
anything about that?

Doctor Mmm, yes it does. You're single, aren't
you?

Patient Yes, well, divorced.

Doctor Because the violin music tells me you want
some romance in your life ~ you're looking for a
partner perhaps?

Patient Yes, yes, I am. In fact, I met a woman last
month — I really like he-r...| think I'm in love with
her. I'm meeting her tonight,

Doctor In your dream you saw an owl in a tree?

Patient Yes, an owl...a big owl.

Doctor The owl represents an older person. I think
you'll need to ask this older person for help.
Maybe this "older person" is me? Maybe you
need my help?

Patient Well, yes, what I really want to know is does
this person, this woman.. .love me?

Simon When I was about 30, I got a job working
as an editor in a publishing company. It was
my first office job, and, um, I didn't really know
what to wear, but, um, for the interview I wore
a suit. In fact, I bought the suit specially for the
interview. I got the job, so Ithought that must
be OK, so, um, on the first day, I went to work
wearing a suit and a tie. I got to work early, um,

I wanted to make a good impression, and I was
the first person in the office, so I went in, I found
my desk, with my name on it, and I sat down and
there were a few papers and documents for me
to read, so I started reading those. I turned on my
computer, and after about ten, fifteen minutes
the other people in the office started to arrive,
and I noticed that nobody else was wearing a
suit, and I thought, OK it's not a big problem. So,
I introduced myself to the other people. I said,
"Hello, how are you? Hello, nice to meet you,"
and the next thing someone said to me was, "My
computer's really slow, do you think you know
what the problem is." and I said, "No, no, not
really." So, then I introduced myself to somebody
else and said, "Hello, nice to meet you," and

she replied, "Hello, nice to meet you," and then
she said, "Do you know how I can connect my
computer to the printer?" and I said, "No, I have
no idea how to do that." Anyway, I went back to
work and about half an hour later I had a meeting
with my boss, and she said, "How's it going?" and
I said, "Yeah, it's all going well, everybody seems
really nice. Just one thing, why does everybody
think I can fix their computer?" and she looked
at me and what I was wearing and she said, "It's
your suit. Nobody in this office wears a suit, so
they think you're from the IT department and
you've come to help with a computer problem.
They're the only ones who wear suits!" So, I never
wore it again. To this day.

Claire It was my first day at work as a teacher at a
language school, and they asked me to come the
first week of the new school year to observe some
teachers, to watch their lessons, and then I was
going to start teaching the following week. But
when I arrived, there they told me that one of the
teachers was sick and they asked me to take the
class, and it was three—year—old kids! So, I was in
a class with about ten three-year-olds who were
running around — my boss gave me a storybook
to read to them, but the kids couldn't speak any
English. l'd never taught — never been trained
to teach children that small. I tried to read the
book to two of them, but the others were running
around shouting and hitting each other, and at
the worst possible moment, just when all of them
were being really noisy and not doing anything I
was telling them to, my boss — the director of the
school ~ opened the door and just looked at me. I
felt terrible but then she said, "These children are
too young for you, aren't they?" and I said yes,

‘.....,’-*<

I was nearly crying. Luckily after that, she never
gave me any classes with really young children,
but it was the most stressful class I've ever tried
to teach.

Host The capital city of Estonia, Tallinn, is one of
the most beautiful cities on the Baltic coast. It
is also one of the world's "smart cities," which
means that technology plays an important role in
people's lives and in business.

But some people in Tallin are using the internet
for something very unusual. It's called the Bank of
Happiness, but it's a very different kind of bank.
Nobody pays money into the bank, and the bank
doesn't lend money to anybody. Instead, the
Bank of Happiness is a forum where thousands

of people from Estonia, and other countries too,
connect with each other, and they offer or receive
services completely free of charge.

Here's how it works: you register and you post
what you are offering or what you need — it's
really easy. For example, people offer to do the
shopping for somebody, or walk their dog. Other
people post things like ''I need someone who can
fix my car" or "Can anybody translate an email
into French for me?" But the important thing is
that nobody pays any money. Everything is free.
The bank was started over five years ago by a
39-year-old Estonian woman, Airi Kivi. She is

a psychologist and a family therapist, and her
goal was to make people think and act with their
hearts.

Airi I thought, we need something like this Bank of
Happiness, where people can meet each other
and help each other—do something cool. The
Estonian economy was also having problems
at the time. A little bit later, I thought, wow, the
Bank of Happiness is perfect for this economic
crisis. A lot of people are unemployed and they
can use our bank. In the Bank of Happiness
people don't need to pay each other back. For
example, a teenager will do the shopping for his
old neighbor, and maybe the neighbor can't do
anything for him in return. But then perhaps the
neighbor will post a comment on the site and tell
people about what the teenager did, and then
another person who sees this will probably do
something to help the teenager. The principle
of the bank is that it's not money and things that
make people happy. What really makes them
happy is doing things for other people.

Max I arrived at the airport in San Juan, Puerto
Rico where I met Nilda. Hola. Soy Max.

Paula Encantacla. Soy Nilda.

Max Nilda took me to my hotel, and that evening
we went to eat, and it was time for my first
test. I had to order a sandwich and a drink in
a cafe, and then askfor the check. I sat down
at a table, and I tried to ordera soda and a
chicken sandwich. Por favor, una refrescay un
emparedado de pollo.

Waiter En seguida.

Max Terrific! The waiter understood me the first
time. My pronunciation wasn't perfect, but I got
my soda and my sandwich. I really enjoyed it.
But then the more difficult part. Asking for the
check... Cuanto es?

Waiter Seis noventa.

Max Como?

Waiter Seis noventa.

Max Six ninety. I understood! Nilda gave me eight
points for the test. I was very happy with that.
Next, we went out on the street. Test number
two was asking for directions and understanding
them. We were on a narrow street and I had to
stop someone and ask him or her for the nearest
drugstore, una farmacia. I stopped a woman. At
first I didn't understand anything she said!

Passer-by Siga todo derecho y tome Ia segunda
Calle al la izquierda. Hay una farmacia en esa
calle.

Max I asked the woman to speak more slowly.

Passer-by Todo clerechoytome la segunda calle
porla izquierda. IZQUIERDA.

Max I got it this time, Ithink. The second street on
the left. I followed the directions and guess what?
There was a drugstore there! Seven points from
Nilda.

Test number three. I wasn't looking forward to this
one. I had to take a taxi to a historical place in San
Juan. Nilda wrote down the name ofthe place on
a piece of paper. It was the name ofan old fort
near the ocean. We stopped a taxi. El Morro, por
favor.

Taxi driver Que? Adoncle?

Max He didn't understand me. I tried again, but he
still didn't understand. I was desperate, so I said
fort, old, water.

Taxi driver Ah, El Morro.

Max Finally! Nilda only gave me five points because
I ended up using English. Still, at least I made the
taxi driver understand where I wanted to go. And
so to the final test. I had to leave a message in
Spanish on somebody's voicemail. I had to give
my name, spell it, and ask the person to call me
back. Nilda gave me the number (it was one of her
friends named Lourdes) and I dialed. Iwas feeling
a little nervous at this point, because talking on
the phone in a foreign language is never easy.

Lola Deje su rnensaje después de la serial.

Max Uh. Buenas noches. Soy Max. Max. M—A- X.

Uh. For favor...llamarme esta noche....Oh yes...a

las 8:30, uh, gracias. Well, my grammar wasn't
correct, but I left the message. Half an hour later,
at eight—thirty, Lourdes called me. Success! Nilda
gave me eight points. That was the end of my four
tests. Nilda was happy with me. My final score was
seven. I was very happy with that. So how much
can you learn in a month? Well, of course you
can't learn Spanish in a month, but you can learn
enough to survive if you are on vacation or on a
trip. Now I want to go back to Washington, D.C.,
and try and learn some more. Adios!

Hi Tracey. You know the answer to your last question,
and it is "yes." You're making your life more difficult.
But it's also true that having a Iong—term relationship
with anyone is difficult, and in your case you can at
least see what some of the problems are. I'm sure

this man loves you and will support you in all your
goals in life, but it's true that he has already done

all the things you want to do. It's not his fault, but it
means that he will never get as excited as you about,
for example, a wedding or having another child. And
everything you experience together he will probably
compare to the last time he did it. You should think
carefully about what kind of partner you really want:
someone who can support you and show you the way
in life, or someone who will discover life with you. You
shouldn't make a decision in a hurry. When you are
clearer about what you want, then you can decide

if you're going to stay with this man or not. Good luck!

Annabel Hello. I'm Annabel.

Peter And I'm Peter.

Expert Hi there, Annabel and Peter. What's your
problem?

Annabel We have a son, Jamie, and he's 25. He's
a chef.

Peter But he still lives with us because he says
it's too expensive to rent an apartment and he
doesn't earn enough money.

Annabel He gives us some money every month for
bills — not much, but a little — and, you know, it's
nice to have him at home, but we think he needs
to be more independent.

Peter Yes, absolutely.

Annabel But last week he told us that he's planning

a two-week vacation to Mexico with his friends.

I mean, it's true that he works fu|l—time and we

know he needs a break, but we really think...
Peter Yes, we don't think he should go on an

expensive vacation when he doesn't give us much

money. We think he should save his money, so that
he can get his own place to live. Should we tell him
that he can't go to Mexico?

Expert You know, to be honest I think you're being
a little hard on him. I mean, he's only 25. It's good
that he has a job and everybody needs a vacation.
My advice is that you should let him go to Mexico,
but when he comes back, you should sit down
with him and talk to him about starting to pay rent.
That way he'll understand that he needs to start
planning for the future and to start thinking about
renting an apartment. But I know from talking to
other parents that there are a lot of young people
still living at home in their 20s and 305, and some
of them don't even have jobs. So, in many ways I
think you're lucky.

Annabel You see? That's just what I think...

Nick Hi there. I'm Nick.

Expert Hi, Nick. So what's your problem?

Nick Well, I've been with my girlfriend for three
years. We have a really great relationship although
we're very different. She's smart and popular and
I'm, uh, quiet and hard-working. Anyway, now she
wants to move to Chicago, because she thinks she
can get a better job there, and she wants me to go
to Chicago, too —you know, Chicago's much more
exciting than Galena, Texas, where we live now.
But I have a goodjob in Galena and I get a good
salary. I mean the idea of moving and having a
new life is like a dream, but for me that's what it is,
I mean it's a dream, it isn't real. What should I do?
Should I follow my heart and move to Chicago with
her? Or should I stay here where I know I have a
good job, but possibly lose my girlfriend?

Expert I think you should sit down together and talk
about your dreams for the future, and see if they
are the same dreams. If they are, and you can see
a future together, then the first thing is for her to
look for a job in Chicago. If she finds one, then
maybe she can move there first and you can go on
weekends and see how you feel about life there.

Nick Thanks a lot for that. I think that's really good
advice.

Jane Hello. My name's Jane.

Expert Hi, Jane. Why are you calling?

Jane Well, a month ago my friend Susan and I
decided to go on vacation together this summer,
to Turkey. So we planned everything and, uh, I
was really looking forward to it because Susan's an
old friend and I don't see her very often. But the
other day she told me that she was telling another
friend of hers about ourvacation, somebody I don't
know, a woman called Angie, and Angie was really
interested, and now Susan has invited herto come,
too. Susan never asked me what I thought! I don't
even know Angie, and I really don't want to go on
vacation with someone I don't know. What should
I do?

Expert I think yourfriend has been a little insensitive,
and she's put you in a difficult position. You have
several different options. You could say that you
aren't going if Angie goes, but then you'll put
Susan in a difficult position. Or you could just
cancel, and suggest taking another vacation
later with just the two of you. Or you could invite
someone else who you like, and then there would
be four of you, which is sometimes a better number
than three. But in fact, you don't know Angie and
maybe you'll like her. So, I think you should try
to get to know her first. If you like her, then the
vacation will probably be a success. if not, then you
should tell your friend you aren't going, because
you don't think it will work with Angie. You know, a
bad vacation is worse than no vacation.

Peter I studied math in college and usually, after

studying math in college, people get a job in

a bank or in IT, but when i graduated, it was

the recession and it was very difficult to get a
job. I was unemployed for a very long time. I
was looking forjobs, and I applied for lots of
different jobs, but they just answered "Sorry,
we don't want you," and l was getting a little
depressed. This went on for about four months,
and then one day I was on a bus — I can even
remember where I was sitting w and my phone
rang. I said hello, and a woman said, ''Hello, you
applied for a job with us a few months ago. Are
you still interested?" So I said, yes, absolutely,
I'm very interested. So then she said "we'd like
you to come for an interview..." and then at that
moment we got cut off because the bus went
into a tunnel. And the phone number wasn't

on my phone ~ itjust said "unknown number,"
and I couldn't remember what the name of the
company was because I'd applied for so many
jobs. So, I thought "four months of nothing and
then when they call, I get cut off." Luckily they
called back the next clay, and in the end I had an
interview, and I got the job.

Sue This happened when I was at a conference in

Thailand. The conference hotel was amazing; it
was in a beautiful national park called Khao Yai,
north of Bangkok. We were very busy with talks
and meetings most of the time, but we had one
free morning, and we could choose from different
trips or activities. I was interested in either a trip
to see birds or a trip to see a tiger. Atiger, not
tigers, because they told us that there was only
one tiger in the whole park! Well, I chose the tiger
trip, because I thought it would be really cool to
see a tiger in the wild. But we had to leave really
early in the morning, because we had to travel

a long way to the part of the park where the

tiger usually was — the bird trip was closer to the
hotel, 50, we tiger—watchers got up at 5:00 in the
morning, but our guide said that we probably
wouldn't see the tiger, because you know, there
was only one tiger. We finally got there and we
spent the whole morning looking for the tiger, but
no luck. But we saw some nice birds, and it was
fun, so when we got back to the conference hotel,
we felt we'd had a really good morning. But then
the other group got back, the ones who went

to see the birds, and of course they saw lots of
amazing birds, but they also saw the tiger! I guess
that day it wasn't in its usual part of the park. And
I thought isn't that typical — you go on the tiger
trip and you don't see the tiger, but the people
on the bird trip see the tigeri

Host So David, what are the five most dangerous

animals in North America? Can you tell us in
reverse order, I mean starting with the fifth most
dangerous?

David Yes, of course. At number five is the

crocodile. They can be over ‘i5 feet long and
weigh up to 1,000 pounds. Crocodiles are very
common in the US state of Florida and some
parts of Mexico. Crocodiles will eat anything
from small animals like fish and birds to large
animals like deer. They don't usually attack
people, except when people walk, play, or
swim in areas where crocodiles live. It's very
uncommon to die from a crocodile attack,
however two to three people die each year from
crocodile bites.

Host Ancl number 4?
David The fourth most dangerous animals in

North America are sharks. Sharks live in both
the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, which surround
North America. More than half of all the shark
attacks in the world happen in the ocean near
California and Florida. In fact, the place where
people are most likely to be attacked by a shark
is Smyrna Beach, on the eastern side of Florida,
especially if you are surfing.

Host And third?

David In third place are snakes. There are a
number of poisonous snakes in North America,
but the most poisonous one is the coral snake.
They can be about -'-1 feet long with black, red,
and yellow bands. They don't usually attack
people, except when people step on them by
accident. A bite from a coral snake can be very
painful, and, can occasionally kill. However,

a coral snake must continue biting for a few
seconds before the poison is injected into you.
So if you can shake off the snake quickly, then the
poison won't go into you.

Host And in second place?

David Bears. While there have only been 27 deaths
from bear attacks in the 20005 in Canada and the
US combined, bears are still highly dangerous.
Of all the bears in North America (black bears.
brown bears, and polar bears), the brown bear is
the most dangerous. They can be almost T0 feet
high and weigh as much as 900 pounds. They
have powerful jaws, sharp teeth, and sharp claws.

Host And in first place?

David Believe it or not...deer. Deer cause about
200 deaths a year in North America, more than
any other animal. These are large animals —
they can weigh 220 pounds. You need to be
especially careful in the fall, when the male
deer can get very aggressive. They also cause
frequent accidents on the road by running out
in front of cars— there are about 100,000 car
accidents a year which involve deer.

Host Well, David, that was certainly...

Interviewer Do you have any phobias’?

Julia Yes, I'm very, very scared ofspiders.

Interviewer And how long have you had this
phobia?

Julia I've had it since I was about 12, so for more
than 30 years.

Interviewer Did something happen to startthe
phobia?

Julia I remember— and it's when I think I started
being frightened — I remember a very big spider
in the apartment that we lived in at the time
coming out from under the TV and going across
the room, and me being absolutely terrified, and
that's the first time I remember being scared.

Interviewer How does it affect your life’?

Julia In the past it was really awful. I mean, I
couldn't sit in the same room as a spider, and I
always had to keep all the doors and windows
shut because I was frightened that spiders might
come in. But I had some therapy, and i can now
sit in the same room as a spider, not for long, it
still has to be moved, and lcan put it in a glass
now and take it outside myself, ifl have to, if
there's nobody else there, so it doesn't affect
me as badly as it did before, but I still don't like
them...

Interviewer What kind of therapy did you have?
How long did it take?

Julia Probably about six weeks. I went to the
therapist's office and he used a kind of hypnosis.
He made me go back to that first incident with
the spider and the TV and we talked about it
again and again until it wasn't so frightening, and
then in the last session he brought in a spider
in a jar, into the room and he made me hold the
jar— I couldn't putthe spider on my hand, but
that was a great improvement, because before
I couldn't even look at a drawing ofa spider in a
children's book, and I certainly couldn't look at
photos of spiders.

Interviewer Wow! Amazing.

Interviewer Do you have any phobias?

Chloe Um, yes, I have a phobia of buttons.

Interviewer Buttons on clothes?

Chloe Yes. I don't like touching them.

Interviewer And how long have you had the
phobia?

Chloe All my life, I think. For as long as I can

remember.
Interviewer Do you know what happened to start
the phobia?

Chloe I don't know exactly, but my mom has told

me that when I was very little, about six or seven
months old, she tried to dress me in a sweater, a
wool sweater with buttons that my grandmother
had made for me, and apparently I screamed and
screamed until she took it off again.

interviewer OK. And how does the phobia affect

your life?

Chloe It really affects the kind of clothes I can buy,

especially in the winter when I need a coat —
there aren't many coats that don't have buttons.
But it's betterthan it was, when I was younger I
refused to wear anything that had buttons, so,
for example, my mother had to adapt my school
clothes so that there were no buttons.

Interviewer Have you had any therapy?
Chloe No, no. I haven't had any therapy. It seems

like such a siliy thing to be afraid of.

Interviewer What about if other people are
wearing clothes with buttons on, is that OK?

Chloe Well, if the buttons aren't touching me that's
fine, but I don't like hugging people that have
buttons on their clothes.

Host Good evening, and welcome to Family, the
Show where we discuss issues concerning parents
and children. Last week, we talked about children
following their parents into the same job, and
whether children of celebrities have an easier life
than other children. Today, we're going to look
at a celebrity son who did something different,
and has been successful without the help of his
famousfather. Duncan Jones may not be a name
you recognize if you're not a serious movie fan.
Duncan Jones is his real name, but when he was
very young, he was called Zowie Bowie. His father
was the famous singer David Bowie, whose real
surname was Jones. Zowie was actually Duncan's
middle name.

Duncan was born in the UK in ‘l9'i'i. When he was
nine his parents divorced, and Duncan stayed
with his father. He continued to visit his mother,
David Bowie’s first wife Angie, until he was 13,
but their relationship wasn't a happy one and he
hasn't seen her since then.

When he was a child, Duncan wasn't interested in
music. His father tried and tried to get him to learn
an instrument, the drums, the saxophone, and the
piano, but Duncan just wasn't interested — he was
more interested in sports, and in movies. So, his
father bought him a little 8 mm video camera, and
he used it to make movies with his Star Wars toys.
After he graduated from high school, Duncan
went to the London Film School and studied to
be a movie director.

In the early years of his career, Duncan directed
TV commercials, for example, for the fashion
label French Connection, and Heinz ketchup, and
he also worked on video games.

in 2006 he made his first movie, called Moon, a
science fiction drama, which was a great success.
He won many awards for the movie, including the
prize for best new British director.

Since then he has made many more successful
movies, including Source Code, a science fiction
thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal, and Warcraft,
based on the game World of Warcraft.

Duncan has said that one of the reasons why he
went into movie directing was that he wanted

to be behind the camera, not in front of it. As a
child there were often paparazzi around, which
he hated. Even now, as a successful movie
director, he doesn't like being photographed.
Although, as he says, "I've never needed to use
my father's name," Duncan was very close to

his father all his life and was with him when he
died, in January 20'l6. He said of him "He was

a wonderful father who encouraged me to be
creative, but different."

Tim Powell isn't a morning person. Which is
surprising, because on weekdays he gets up very
early. While most of us are still asleep, Powell wakes
up at 5:45, exercises for 30 minutes at his home
gym, and has a big breakfast. Then he gets ready
for work and drives to the office. When he gets to
the building where he works, he goes for a walk
around a local park, and then he goes inside to
start work at 9‘. And on Thursdays he gets up even
earlier, at 5:20 a.m., to study German.

Powell is a lawyer. He works 7'0 hours a week, and
he says that getting up early helps him to do more
during the day. He isn't the only one — many busy,
successful people get up very early.

Experts agree that getting up early is a big help

if you have a lot ofthings to do. There are three
main reasons for this. The first reason why it's good
to get up early is that the early morning is quiet.
Nobody calls you at 6:00 am. There aren't any
important emails or messages to answer. There
aren't any meetings. There aren't any people. The
morning is yourtime.

The second reason is that if you get up early, you
go to bed early. Most people don't do anything
useful in the evenings. People who go to bed

late spend many hours watching TV, seeing their
friends, and spending time on social media. So, if
you want to do a lot, it's better to go to bed early,
and have shorter evenings and longer mornings.
The third reason is that it's better to do things in the
morning, when you have energy. Most people are
tired after a day at work or school. And when you're
tired, the last thing you want to do is to exercise, or
to study, or to practice a musical instrument.

And if you find it impossible to get up early? Set
your alarm five minutes earlier than you usually

get up. And the next day, set it five minutes earlier
again. Afterthree weeks, you'll have nearly two
hours that you never had before!

1 Interviewer Did you like school?
A I didn't hate school, but I don't think! liked
it very much. I used to enjoy PE, I used to enjoy
playing sports. Um, I liked English but there
were a lot of subjects I didn't like. I didn't like
math very much, history was boring, and I found
science difficult. I had a small group of friends,
not many, but a close group of friends and I used
to spend time with them talking about sports,
talking about music, so it wasn't too bad, but I
didn't like it very much. I've never been back to
school, I've never been to a school reunion, or
anything like that.

2 Interviewer Did you like school?

B No, not really. I didn't like it at all.

Interviewer Why not?

B It was a boys' school and I got bored with just

being with boys all the time. And I didn't really

like any of the subjects.

Interviewer Did you like school?

C Well, yes and no. Some things I really loved,

some things I thought "this isn't much fun," but I

used to enjoy a lot of subjects.

Interviewer Like what?

C I liked English and I liked math.

Interviewer And what didn't you enjoy?

C I hated geography. And I hated PE. The PE

teacher once caught me reading a book on the

soccer field, and l was punished for that.

4 Interviewer Did you like school?
D I didn't like it, I absolutely loved it! I liked all
the subjects, especially English and history. I
remember one time when I was about six or
seven, I got sick during spring break and I was
really, really sad, and my mom thought I was sad
because I was sick during vacation, but in fact,
I was terrified that I'd never get better and I'd
never go back to school.

5 Interviewer Did you like school?

E Uh, sometimes. Yeah, most of the time.
Interviewer What did you like about it?

E Well, I had some good friends, and I liked
learning things, but there were some subjects that
l didn't like very much, and I hated PE. i used to
invent a lot of excuses, like saying that I was sick,
because I didn't want to do it.

6 Interviewer Did you like school?

F Yes, definitely, I really enjoyed school.
Elementary school was all fun and we had great
teachers. I always really looked forward to getting
back to school. High school was harder work and
we used to have lots of exams and tests, but we
had really inspiring teachers. My favorites were in
math and biology. And overall, yeah, I really liked
it.

Buying jeans isn't as easy as it used to be. Years ago,
there was only one kind ofjeans — probably Levis.
Nowadays, there are hundreds— different styles,
different colors, different lengths, with buttons, with
zippers. There are so many options that you feel the
perfect pair must be waiting for you somewhere...
And it isn'tjustjeans. In big supermarkets, we have
to choose between thousands of products — my
local supermarket has 35 different kinds of milk!
When we're buying clothes or electrical gadgets,
ordering a coffee in a cafe, looking for a hotel

on a travel website, deciding which TV channel

to watch, or even choosing a future partner on a
dating website, we constantly have to choose from
hundreds of possibilities.

People often think that being able to choose from a
lot of options is a good thing.

However, university researchers have discovered
that too much choice is making us feel unhappy and
dissatisfied. The problem is that we have so many
options that we get stressed every time we have

to make a decision because we're worried about
making the wrong one. Then when we choose one
thing, we feel bad because we think we are missing
other opportunities, and this makes us dissatisfied
with what we've chosen.

Research also shows that we feel happier when we
have less choice. In a study, Professor Mark Lepper
at Stanford University found that people who tried
six kinds of jam and then chose one felt happier with
their choice than those who were offered 24 jams
to taste.

But if all this choice is bad for us, what can we do
about it? Professor Lepper suggests that we should
try to relax when we have to decide what to buy.
"Don't take these choices too seriously or it will
become stressful," he says. "If you pick a sofa from
IKEA in 30 seconds, you'll feel better than if you
spend hours researching sofas — because you won't
know what you're missing."

i went on the Twin Strangers website. All you have
to do is pay $3.95, upload a photo of your face,

and then describe it, your nose, mouth, and eyes. I
looked in a mirror and decided that I have an oval
face, blue eyes and, unfortunately, thin lips.
Immediately, I got a lot of photos of possible
matches. My first reaction was "they all look totally
different from me." Then something interesting
began to happen. Some of the people started to
look familiar, like people in my family. I found one
woman who looked just like my brother. I started to
wonder. Was there something there?

I called my husband to come and take a look at all
these "twins." His first reaction was the same as
mine, but then he went quiet. He pointed to one
woman who, at first sight, looks completely different
from me, but whose picture I had stopped at several
times. He said, "She has the same mouth as you. In
fact, she‘: a little like you." And he was right.

I decided to change my profile a little. Many people
tell me I look younger than I really am, so I put my
age as ten years younger, and then searched again.

The result was surprising. Suddenly, there seemed
to be a number of women a little like me. Especially
one. I put her picture on my Facebook page and
asked my friends what they thought. The first person
to answer was my brother. Yes, he wrote. She looks
like you and our sister.

It's a strange feeling. I keep looking at her picture.
We're very similar, but not identical, for example,
she has brown eyes, but mine are blue. But there's
something there. Not just the blonde hair and

the thin lips. There's something in her eyes thatl
recognize. It's a very strange feeling, but I'm really
happy that I found her. I sent her a message through
the website, but she hasn't replied yet. I'm going to
keep trying. I want to know who she is.

Iris Hello, Rosemary. How are you this morning?

Rosemary Hello, Iris. I'm fine thanks, but you'll never
guess what's happened. Jack and Emma have
broken up!

Iris No! Jack and Emma, from next door? That can't
be true. I saw them last week, and they looked
really happy.

Rosemary No, it's definitely true. I heard them
shouting. They were having a terrible argument.

Iris No! When?

Rosemary Last night. After he came home from
work.

Iris What did they say?

Rosemary Well, I wasn't really listening...

Iris Of course not.

Rosemary But I couldn't help hearing. She was
talking so loudly, and of course, the walls are very
thin...

Iris So what did they say?

Rosemary Well, she said that she was going to stay
with her mother! She told him that she wouldn't
come back.

Iris Ooh, how awful. What aboutthe children?

Rosemary She said she'd taken them to her sister's.
I suppose she'll take them with her in the end. And
anyway, then five minutes later I saw her leaving
the house with a suitcase!

Iris No! Why do you think she's leaving him? Is he
seeing another woman?

Rosemary I don't know. Ooh, here's my bus.

Iris I have to go and tell Mrs. Jones from across the
street. She always thought there was something...
something strange about him.

Jack Hi, Emma. I'm back, Where are you?

Emma I'm upstairs in the bedroom. I'm packing.

Jack Why? Where are you going?

Emma I'm going to stay with my mom.

Jack Your mom? Why?

Emma She's had an accident. She fell on the street
yesterday and she's broken her leg.

Jack How awful. Poor thing, Can I help you with
anything?

Emma Actually, yes. Could you get my small suitcase
in the closet?

Jack How long do you think you'll have to stay?

Emma I won't come back until the weekend, I don't
think. I'll have to make sure she's OK. I've taken the
children to my sister's for the night, and she'll take
them to school tomorrow morning. Can you pick
them up after school?

Jack Of course I can, honey. Now, don't worry about
anything. We'll be absolutelyfine, and here's your
suitcase.

Emma Thanks, clear. The taxi'll be here in five

1 We use if + past to talk about an imaginary or hypothetical
future situation and would] wouldn't + base form to talk
about the consequence.

0 would + base form is sometimes known as the conditional
tense. We also use it without an if-clause to talk about
imaginary or hypothetical situations e.g., I'd never have a cat

0 wouldl wouldn't = is the same for all persons. Contractions:
‘oi = would (l’d, you'd, he’d, etc); wouldn't = would not.

10A expressing movement

  

D come or go?
We use come for movement toward you, and go for
movement away from you.

 

   

I ran over the bridge and across the park.

0 To express movement, we use a verb of movement, e.g.,
go, come, run, walk, etc., and a preposition (or adverb) of

When the object is a pronoun (me, it, him, etc.) it always goes

between the verb and particle.

Here's your coat. Put it on. NOT J2i=it~en»+'te

3 Some phrasal verbs have an object and are inseparable,
e.g., look for. With these phrasal verbs the verb (e.g., look)
